You can host modernGraphTool and CrinGraph together with slight change of code!

This chapter showcases how to dual-host 2 graphtools in 1 domain, using modernGraphTool as main forefront page.

## Overview

There are several ways to host two services on a single domain.

Here, we showcase the classic "folder as subdomain" approach, which is simple and effective for static sites or web apps.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare Your Projects

- **modernGraphTool**: Set up the modernGraphTool database and files as described in the [other documentation chapters](../../guide-for-admins/index.mdx).
- **CrinGraph**: Prepare the CrinGraph project files. You can use any variant of CrinGraphs.

### 2. Organize Your Directory Structure

Your root folder should contain the main `index.html` for modernGraphTool.

Create a new folder (e.g., `cringraph`) inside the root directory, and place all CrinGraph files there.

The `cringraph` folder should also have its own `index.html`.

Example structure:

```plaintext
/project-root/
├── data
|   ├── phones          # 'phone' measurements folder
|   |   ├── A8 L.txt      # measurement data
|   |   └── A8 R.txt      # measurement data
|   ├── target          # 'target' measurements folder
|   |   └── Target.txt    # target data
|   └── phone_book.json # List of phones
├── index.html          # modernGraphTool entry point
├── ...other modernGraphTool files...
└── cringraph
    ├── index.html      # CrinGraph entry point
    └── ...other CrinGraph files...
```

### 3. Required Changes to CrinGraph

Since we don't want to manage 2 data folders for each graphtool respectively, We need to update CrinGraph's code to correctly fetch data from parent directory.

Required changes will be made in two files:

- `graphtool.js`
- `config.js` (and `config_hp.js` if you have one)

The following examples are based on the [squiglink/labs version](https://github.com/squiglink/lab) of CrinGraph.

:::tip[Tip]
Even if you are using a different version of CrinGraph, you should be able to follow the examples below without any problems. However, there may be slight differences in details such as line positions.
:::

#### graphtool.js

Open `graphtool.js` and find the `loadFiles` function (near the bottom of the file). Edit it as follows:

```js
// Previous
let l = (f) => d3.text(DIR + f + '.txt').catch(() => null);
let f = p.isTarget
	? [l(p.fileName)]
	: d3.merge(LR.map((s) => sampnums.map((n) => l(p.fileName + ' ' + s + n))));

// After
// If you're using custom directory for measurements, change the 'phones' and 'target' words to yours.
let l = (f) => d3.text(DIR + 'phones/' + f + '.txt').catch(() => null);
let lt = (f) => d3.text(DIR + 'target/' + f + '.txt').catch(() => null);
let f = p.isTarget
	? [lt(p.fileName)]
	: d3.merge(LR.map((s) => sampnums.map((n) => l(p.fileName + ' ' + s + n))));
```

#### config.js

Find the `DIR` variable at the top of `config.js` and edit it:

```js
// Previous
DIR = "data/",

// After
// '../' means 'parent directory'.
DIR = "../data/",
```

If you're using Haruto's iteration of CrinGraph ([PublicGraphTool](https://github.com/HarutoHiroki/PublicGraphTool) / [ExtendedGraphTool](https://github.com/potatosalad775/ExtendedGraphTool)), you'll also need to repoint the `PHONE_BOOK` variable in the same file:

```js
// Previous
PHONE_BOOK = "phone_book.json", // Path to phone book JSON file

// After
PHONE_BOOK = "../data/phone_book.json", // Path to phone book JSON file
```

:::note[CDN-mode installs: leave `BASE_PATH` unset]
Because modernGraphTool is served from the **root** of its (sub)domain in this layout, leave `CDN_MODE.BASE_PATH` unset (or commented out) in `config.js`. If you later move mGT into a subfolder, you'll need to set `BASE_PATH` to match — see the [CDN deployment guide](../../guide-for-admins/deployment/cdn.mdx#why-base_path-is-almost-always-required) for the full explanation.

### 4. Add Navigation Buttons to Each Tool

After finishing the code-weaving job above, you should be able to access 2 graphtools via these domains.

- To access modernGraphTool: `https://yourdomain.com/`
- To access CrinGraph: `https://yourdomain.com/cringraph/` (Folder name as subdomain)

We can add little buttons so users can easily navigate between these two.

#### modernGraphTool

Find the `TOPBAR` block in `config.js` and add a `LINK_LIST` entry. `LINK_LIST` is an array of `{ TITLE, URL }` objects — you can add more entries later if you want extra navigation buttons.

```js
TOPBAR: {
  LINK_LIST: [
    { TITLE: "Go to CrinGraph", URL: "https://yourdomain.com/cringraph" },
    // or, relative to the mGT root:
    // { TITLE: "Go to CrinGraph", URL: "./cringraph" },
  ],
}
```

#### CrinGraph

Head over to line 250 of `config.js` for `headerLinks` array, and add these line:

```js
headerLinks = [
	{
		name: 'Head back to modernGraphTool',
		url: 'https://yourdomain.com/'
	},
	// or
	{
		name: 'Head back to modernGraphTool',
		url: '../'
	}
];
```

### 5. Deploying

Upload your project to your web server, ensuring the folder structure is preserved.

Both tools should now be accessible as described above.

:::tip[Tip]
If you are applying these changes to your `squig.link` database, the changes might not be shown immediately due to cached files.

You can apply these changes immediately by refreshing the cache. Add `?cachebust` to the end of your database address, then reload the page.

```plaintext
e.g) https://example.squig.link/?cachebust
```
