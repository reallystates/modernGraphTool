You can serve modernGraphTool and CrinGraph from the same domain, with both reading one `data/` folder — handy while you migrate, or to keep offering the classic interface to visitors who prefer it.

The layout is "folder as subpath": one tool sits at the domain root, the other in a subfolder with its own `index.html`. Pick the guide for whichever tool should be the front page:

- **[modernGraphTool as main](./main-mgt.mdx)** — modernGraphTool at the root, CrinGraph in a subfolder such as `/cringraph/`.
- **[CrinGraph as main](./main-cringraph.mdx)** — CrinGraph stays at the root, modernGraphTool in a subfolder such as `/mGT/`.

This works because both tools read the same `phone_book.json` dialect. modernGraphTool-only keys such as `variants[]` sit alongside the `file` key CrinGraph reads, so one file serves both — see [Managing Data](../../guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx).
