This page is for operators moving an existing [CrinGraph](https://github.com/mlochbaum/CrinGraph) database — or any of its popular derivatives — to modernGraphTool v2.

The good news: the core data (FR `.txt` files, `phone_book.json`, target files) is format-compatible and carries over without modification. The work is mostly in **restructuring the `data/` folder**, **regenerating the config** in v2's format, and **re-applying page metadata**.

:::tip[Looking for the highlights?]
For a feature-level overview of what v2 brings to the table, see [What's New in v2](./whats-new-in-v2.mdx) — especially useful if you're deciding whether to migrate at all.

## Which fork are you coming from?

CrinGraph has a long history and several actively maintained forks. The migration steps are largely the same, but each fork has structural quirks worth naming up front.

|                    | Vanilla CrinGraph                | [squiglink lab](https://github.com/squiglink/lab)     | [PublicGraphTool](https://github.com/HarutoHiroki/PublicGraphTool)             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Config file        | `config.js` (root)               | `config.js` (root), `config_hp.js` for HP variant     | `assets/js/config.js`                                                          |
| Phone FR files     | `data/*.txt` (flat)              | `data/*.txt` (flat)                                   | `data/*.txt` (flat)                                                            |
| Target files       | `data/*.txt` (mixed with phones) | `data/*.txt` (mixed with phones)                      | Split: some in `data/*Target.txt`, more in `data/targets/`                     |
| `phone_book.json`  | Optional (often absent)          | `data/phone_book.json`                                | `data/phone_book.json`                                                         |
| Preference bounds  | None                             | None                                                  | `assets/pref_bounds/Bounds L.txt` + `Bounds R.txt`                             |
| Theme CSS          | `style*.css` at root             | `style*.css` + `styles/dark.css` + `styles/white.css` | `assets/css/extra.css` + `style*.css`                                          |
| Headphones variant | Usually a separate install       | `data_hp/` folder + `config_hp.js`                    | `data_hp/` folder + `headphones.html` + `config_hp.js`                         |
| External scripts   | None                             | None                                                  | `squigsites.js`, `reinvented-color-wheel.min.js`, `90inclusion.js`, audio tags |

If your fork isn't listed here, it almost certainly behaves like one of these three. The steps below call out fork-specific differences inline as **Lab**, **PublicGraphTool**, and **Vanilla** notes.

## Compatibility

**Format-compatible, carries over unchanged:**

- FR measurement `.txt` files (tab/space-separated `freq dB` columns)
- Target `.txt` files (same format)
- `phone_book.json` schema (see [Managing Data](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx) if you need to create one)
- Watermark images, logos, favicon images

**Not compatible, needs regeneration:**

- `config.js` — CrinGraph uses top-level `const` bindings (`const init_phones = [...], DIR = "data/"`); v2 uses a single structured `CONFIG = { ... }` object. The fields are mostly equivalent but the format is entirely different.
- Theme/stylesheet CSS — CrinGraph's styles are scattered across multiple files with hard-coded hex values; v2 uses a single `theme.css` with CSS custom properties (OKLCH-based).
- Folder layout — CrinGraph keeps phones and targets mixed in a single `data/` folder; v2 expects them split into `data/phones/` and `data/target/`.

**Does not carry over at all:**

- CrinGraph's JS files (`graphtool.js`, `equalizer.js`, `listAugment.js`, `saveSvgAsPng.js`, `graphAnalytics.js`)
- Bundled libraries (`d3.v5.min.js`, `fuse.min.js`, `reinvented-color-wheel.min.js`)
- External scripts pulled from `squig.link/squigsites.js` — v2 has native squig.link integration via the `SQUIGLINK` config section. Remove the script tag.

## Migration Steps

1. **Download** the [latest modernGraphTool v2 release](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/releases) and extract it.

2. **Restructure your `data/` folder.** v2 expects phones and targets in separate subfolders:

   ```plaintext
   data/
   ├── phones/            # all your phone FR .txt files
   │   ├── IEM A L.txt
   │   ├── IEM A R.txt
   │   └── ...
   ├── target/            # all your target curve .txt files
   │   ├── Harman IE 2019v2 Target.txt
   │   └── ...
   └── phone_book.json    # unchanged
   ```

   Move every non-target FR file into `data/phones/`, and every target file into `data/target/`. Targets are usually easy to identify — they end in `Target.txt`, or they appear by name in the `targets` array of your old CrinGraph config.

   - **Lab note**: All files in your old flat `data/` folder need to be sorted. The `data/phone_book.json` moves as-is.
   - **PublicGraphTool note**: You have a partial split already — `data/targets/` contains many of your target files. Merge `data/targets/*.txt` **and** any `data/*Target.txt` files at the root of `data/` into v2's `data/target/`. Everything else goes into `data/phones/`.
   - **Vanilla CrinGraph note**: If you don't already have a `phone_book.json`, you'll need to create one. See [Managing Data](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx) for the schema and a minimal example.

3. **Move Preference Bound files** _(PublicGraphTool only)_ — v2 expects bound data files at `data/Bounds U.txt` and `data/Bounds D.txt` (upper/lower). PublicGraphTool stored them at `assets/pref_bounds/Bounds L.txt` and `Bounds R.txt` (left/right). Copy them over and **rename**:

   - `assets/pref_bounds/Bounds L.txt` → `data/Bounds U.txt`
   - `assets/pref_bounds/Bounds R.txt` → `data/Bounds D.txt`

   Also make sure your compensation baseline (usually a KEMAR DF or similar) is present in `data/target/`, and record its filename (without extension) — you'll set `PREFERENCE_BOUND.BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE` to it in the next step.

4. **Generate a new `config.js`** — CrinGraph's config format is incompatible with v2, so the cleanest approach is to build a fresh one using the [**Config Editor**](/config-generator), referencing your old config for the values. A few common field mappings to speed you along:

   | CrinGraph (old)                                                       | modernGraphTool v2 (new)                                               |
   | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `init_phones = [...]`                                                 | `INITIAL_PHONES: [...]`                                                |
   | `targets = [{ type, files }]`                                         | `TARGET_MANIFEST: [{ type, files }]`                                   |
   | `DIR = "data/"`                                                       | `PATH.PHONE_MEASUREMENT`, `PATH.TARGET_MEASUREMENT`, `PATH.PHONE_BOOK` |
   | `default_normalization = "Hz" / "dB"`                                 | `NORMALIZATION.TYPE` (`"Hz"` or `"Avg"`)                               |
   | `default_norm_hz = 500`                                               | `NORMALIZATION.HZ_VALUE: 500`                                          |
   | `default_y_scale = "40db"`                                            | `VISUALIZATION.DEFAULT_Y_SCALE: 40`                                    |
   | `watermark_text`, `watermark_image_url`                               | `WATERMARK: [{ TYPE, CONTENT, ... }]`                                  |
   | `rig_description`                                                     | `VISUALIZATION.RIG_DESCRIPTION`                                        |
   | `labelsPosition = "bottom-left"`                                      | `VISUALIZATION.LABEL.LOCATION: "BOTTOM_LEFT"`                          |
   | `headerLinks = [...]`                                                 | `TOPBAR.LINK_LIST: [...]`                                              |
   | `page_title`, `page_description`                                      | Set in `index.html` `<title>` / `<meta>` (step 6)                      |
   | `themingEnabled`, `alt_layout`, `alt_*` flags                         | Not needed — v2's theme and layout are always on                       |
   | `extraEQBands`, `extraEQplugins`                                      | Not needed — v2 has built-in Interactive EQ and Device PEQ             |
   | `preference_bounds_dir`, `preference_bounds_name`                     | `PREFERENCE_BOUND.BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE` + file location in `data/`      |
   | `tiltableTargets`, `compTargets`                                      | `TARGET_CUSTOMIZER.CUSTOMIZABLE_TARGETS`                               |
   | `default_tilt`, `default_bass_shelf`, `default_ear`, `default_treble` | `TARGET_CUSTOMIZER.INITIAL_TARGET_FILTERS`                             |
   | `allowSquigDownload`, `analyticsEnabled`                              | `SQUIGLINK.ENABLE_*` fields                                            |
   | `default_DF_name`                                                     | Used as the name in `PREFERENCE_BOUND.BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE`             |

   For the field-by-field reference of every v2 option, see [Customizing the Page → `config.js`](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#changing-basic-settings-configjs).

5. **Generate a new `theme.css`** — use the [**Theme Generator**](/theme-generator) to build a v2-compatible theme visually. You can eyeball the colors from your old stylesheets:

   - **Lab**: start from `styles/dark.css` / `styles/white.css` for the dark/light palettes and `style-alt-theme.css` for accent colors.
   - **PublicGraphTool**: `assets/css/extra.css` holds most of the custom CSS variables (look for `--accent-color-contrast`, `--background-color`); `dark.css` / `theme-*.css` hold the rest.
   - **Vanilla**: `style.css` and `style-alt.css`.

   Drop the generated `theme.css` alongside your new `index.html` and `config.js`.

6. **Migrate page metadata (`index.html`)** — v2 ships with its own `index.html`; the edits you made to your CrinGraph `index.html` do **not** carry over automatically. Re-apply them:

   - `<title>` and `<meta name="title">` (CrinGraph `page_title`)
   - `<meta name="description">` (CrinGraph `page_description`)
   - Open Graph tags: `<meta property="og:title">`, `<meta property="og:description">`, `<meta property="og:url">`, `<meta property="og:image">`
   - `<link rel="canonical">`
   - Favicons: `<link rel="icon">`, `<link rel="shortcut icon">`, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` — repoint these to your own image files (copy them into `assets/images/` first)
   - `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title">`
   - Web app manifest: `<link rel="manifest">` (if you have one)

   The [Customizing the Page → Changing Page Metadata](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#changing-page-metadata-indexhtml) section has the full field-by-field reference.

   **Things that should NOT be carried over from your CrinGraph `index.html`:**

   - `<script src="https://squig.link/squigsites.js"></script>` — v2 has native squig.link integration. Enable it via the `SQUIGLINK` section in `config.js` instead. Cross-site search, sponsor banner, and multi-GA4 analytics are all built in.
   - `<script src="assets/js/graphAnalytics.js"></script>` — v2 analytics are routed through `SQUIGLINK.ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_IDS` (an array, so multi-tag support works out of the box).
   - `<script src="assets/js/reinvented-color-wheel.min.js"></script>` + `reinvented-color-wheel.min.css` — v2 has a built-in color picker on every curve's color swatch.
   - `<audio id="pinkNoiseAudio">` / `<audio id="scarletFIRE">` tags — not a v2 feature.
   - `<script src="assets/js/90inclusion.js"></script>` — PublicGraphTool-specific; not applicable to v2.
   - Google Fonts `<link>` tags for Open Sans / Source Sans Pro — v2 ships with the Pretendard Variable font by default. Keep them only if you're intentionally replacing the font stack.

   :::note[Source builders]
   If you build from source, edit `src/app.html` instead of `index.html`. The output `dist/index.html` is generated from that template.
   :::

7. **Delete CrinGraph-specific files** — once steps 1–6 are complete, your old CrinGraph files are no longer needed in the v2 folder. Safe to remove:

   - `graphtool.js`, `equalizer.js`, `listAugment.js`, `saveSvgAsPng.js`, `graphAnalytics.js`
   - `d3.v5.min.js`, `d3-selection-multi.v1.min.js`, `fuse.min.js`, `reinvented-color-wheel.min.js`
   - `style.css`, `style-alt.css`, `style-alt-theme.css`, `styles/` (folder), `extra.css`, any CrinGraph-specific theme CSS
   - `cringraph-favicon.png`, `cringraph-icon*.png`, `cringraph-logo.svg` (keep your own branding images)
   - `90inclusion.js`, audio asset files if they were only used by the old `<audio>` tags
   - `devicePEQ/` plugin folder — v2 has built-in Device PEQ
   - Old `config.js`, `config_hp.js`, `headphones.html`, `graph_*.html`, `iframe.html`

   Keep your `data/` folder, your new `config.js`, your new `theme.css`, your favicon/watermark images, and v2's own files.

8. **Test locally** and deploy.

:::note[Why there's no `headphones.html` in v2]
PublicGraphTool ships a dual-instance layout with `headphones.html` + `data_hp/` + `config_hp.js`, and squiglink lab has a similar `config_hp.js` + `data_hp/` pattern. modernGraphTool v2 intentionally does **not** reproduce this.

The squig.link service model hosts earphone and headphone databases as **separate sibling directories** on the same (sub)domain — e.g. `username.squig.link/` for earphones and `username.squig.link/headphones/` for headphones — each one a standalone deployment with its own `data/`, `config.js`, and `theme.css`. This keeps each instance single-purpose and simpler to reason about, and it's how squig.link service expects deployments to be structured for features like cross-instance search and unified analytics.

If you're migrating from a dual-instance CrinGraph setup, treat it as two separate migrations: one earphone deployment and one headphone deployment, each following the steps on this page independently. For the headphone instance in a subdirectory, see the [`BASE_PATH` note](#if-you-pick-cdn-mode-watch-out-for-base_path) below.
:::

## Picking a Deployment Option

modernGraphTool v2 offers four deployment paths:

- **[Pre-built Release](./guide-for-admins/deployment/prebuilt.mdx)** — Closest to how you deploy CrinGraph today. Download the release, drop your `data/`, `config.js`, and `theme.css` in, upload. No `BASE_PATH` to worry about.
- **[CDN Deployment](./guide-for-admins/deployment/cdn.mdx)** — Recommended, and a thinner drop: only your `index.html`, `config.js`, `theme.css`, `data/`, and `assets/` live on your server; the app bundle loads from jsDelivr and auto-updates with new v2 releases.
- **[GitHub Pages](./guide-for-admins/deployment/github-pages.mdx)** — CDN deployment hosted on GitHub for free, if you'd rather stop maintaining a web server as part of this migration.
- **[Building from Source](./guide-for-admins/deployment/from-source.mdx)** — For developers and forks.

:::tip[CDN Alternative]
Instead of hosting the full pre-built release, consider the [CDN deployment mode](./guide-for-admins/deployment/cdn.mdx). You don't need to manage the app code, and future updates apply automatically with it.
:::

### If you pick CDN mode, watch out for `BASE_PATH`

In v2 CDN mode, any deployment **not** at the root of its (sub)domain requires `CDN_MODE.BASE_PATH` in `config.js`. Without it, the home page loads fine but every share link 404s. The fix is one config line. For a site at `example.com/headphones/`:

```javascript
CDN_MODE: {
  MAJOR_VERSION: 2,
  BASE_PATH: "/headphones",
},
```

Full explanation and worked examples: [Why `BASE_PATH` is almost always required](./guide-for-admins/deployment/cdn.mdx#why-base_path-is-almost-always-required).

This matters most for the headphone sibling deployment mentioned above — your earphone instance at the subdomain root doesn't need `BASE_PATH`, but the headphone instance at `/headphones/` does.

### Already running CrinGraph alongside another tool?

If you want to keep CrinGraph as the primary front page and run modernGraphTool in a subfolder (or vice versa), the [Dual-hosting guide](./database-tips/dual-hosting/main-cringraph.mdx) walks through that layout end-to-end — including how to share a single `data/` folder between both tools.
