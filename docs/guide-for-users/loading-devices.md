The **Device panel** is where you choose what actually gets drawn on the graph. Open it from the menu carousel (it's the first icon) or press **1** on desktop.

## Header and panes

The Device panel has a fixed **header bar** at the top containing a search field, and (up to) two columns below it:

- **Brand pane** on the left — a vertical list of every brand in the database.
- **Phone pane** on the right — the scrollable list of devices, filtered by whatever you've picked in the brand pane and whatever you've typed in the search field.

The search field sits in the header and spans both panes, so you can search by name no matter which pane is visible.

On wide screens both panes show side-by-side. On narrow screens (mobile, or a very skinny panel) only one is visible at a time, and you switch between them with **Brand** / **Devices** buttons that appear in the header next to the search field.

## Filtering by brand

Click a brand name in the brand pane to filter the phone list to just that brand. Click more brands to add them to the filter — the filter is additive, not exclusive, so selecting _Sennheiser_ and _Sony_ shows devices from both. A highlighted left border and a stronger text color mark the brands you've picked.

When one or more brands are selected, a **Clear selected brands** button appears at the top of the panel. Use it to reset the filter back to "show everything".

:::tip
If no brand is selected, the phone pane shows every device in the database. Most people either use brand filtering to narrow things down _or_ just search — both work fine.

## Searching

The search field in the header does a live substring match against device names. It works together with brand filtering: if you've picked two brands and then type into the search box, you'll only see matching devices from those brands.

The **i** button beside the field opens a short list of search tips, so the syntax below is discoverable without leaving the panel.

Separate several devices with commas — `hd 600, u12t` shows every device matching either one, so you can load both sides of a comparison without clearing the box in between. Commas mean something stronger in cross-site results, below.

Clear the search box to get back to the full filtered list.

## Loading and unloading

Click a device to **load** it. A colored curve appears on the graph, and the device row gets a highlighted left border and shows a bit of extra metadata — review score, price, review link, shop link if available. Click the device again to **unload** it (unless your site has locked loaded devices in place; that's an operator setting).

There's no limit on how many devices you can load at once, other than readability — three or four is usually the sweet spot for visual comparison.

If a device has a short loading spinner next to it while the file is being fetched, that's normal. Individual FR files are tiny and should load almost instantly.

## Loaded devices come first

Every time you open the Device panel, the devices you already have loaded are moved to the top of the list, above a thicker divider line. On a large database that saves scrolling back down to whatever you were comparing.

The order is decided once, when the panel opens, and then stays put — loading or unloading a device does **not** shuffle the list under your cursor. A device you unload keeps its place above the divider until you leave the panel and come back.

## Cross-site search

The phone pane also shows matching devices from _other_ measurement databases underneath the local results. These appear only while a search query is active and let you jump to another site that has the device you're looking for.

A comma-separated query narrows this to databases carrying **all** of the devices you named — `hd 600, u12t` lists only the sites that measured both, which is what you want when you're after two curves from the same rig. See [Cross-Site Search](../features/cross-site-search.mdx) for the full story.

## Uploading your own measurement

Switch to the **Graph panel** and scroll to the bottom of the selection list. You'll find a **Graph Uploader** with two buttons:

- **Upload FR** — load the file as a headphone measurement.
- **Upload target** — load the file as a target curve instead.

Click the button that matches what you're uploading, pick one or more `.txt` files from your computer, and they appear on the graph as if they were local devices or targets. The accepted format is the standard CrinGraph-style two-column `frequency\tSPL` text file — the same format modernGraphTool and CrinGraph both use for their on-disk device databases. You can use this to:

- Overlay your own measurements against the ones the site hosts.
- Compare a target curve you found online against the built-in targets.
- Sanity-check a file before sharing it.

### Left/right channels and multiple files

You can select several files at once, and **Upload FR** pairs left/right channels into a single device — exactly like the site's hosted measurements. Name the files with a matching base name plus an `L` or `R` channel marker, separated by a space, underscore, or dash:

| Files you select                    | What you get                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `HD600 L.txt`, `HD600 R.txt`        | One device "HD600" with L, R, and AVG curves    |
| `HD600_L.txt`, `HD600-R.txt`        | Same — `_` and `-` markers work too             |
| `HD600 L.txt`, `HD650 L.txt`, …     | One device per base name, grouped automatically |
| `HD600 L.txt` (no matching R)       | A single-channel device showing just that side  |
| `MyMeasurement.txt` (no L/R marker) | One curve, as before                            |

**Upload target** also accepts multiple files (each becomes its own target); targets are always single-curve, so channel markers don't apply.

Uploaded files live only in your browser session — they're not uploaded anywhere. Reload the page and they're gone.

Once you have at least one curve on screen, the per-curve controls become useful. [Working with curves](./working-with-curves.mdx) covers them.
