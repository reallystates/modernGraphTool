modernGraphTool v2 is a ground-up rewrite. The application code is entirely new, but your data and configuration carry over with minimal changes.

This page is a reference for everything that changed and everything that's new. If you're actively migrating an existing database, head to [Migrating from v1 to v2](./migrating-v1-to-v2.mdx) or [Migrating from CrinGraph](./migrating-from-cringraph.mdx) — they point back here where useful.

## What Changed

### Tech Stack

|               | v1                                  | v2                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Framework** | Vanilla JavaScript + Web Components | SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 (Runes) |
| **Bundler**   | Rollup                              | Vite                           |
| **Styling**   | Custom CSS                          | Tailwind CSS 4 + CSS variables |
| **i18n**      | Custom JSON loader                  | Paraglide JS (compile-time)    |
| **Testing**   | None                                | Vitest + Playwright            |

### Extensions are Now Built-in

In v1, features were loaded as extensions via `extensions/extensions.config.js`. This offered modularity, but in practice most users kept every extension enabled, and managing separate extension folders and configs added unnecessary complexity.

In v2, **all extensions are built-in Svelte components** configured through a single `config.js`. The `extensions/` folder and `extensions.config.js` are gone.

| v1 (`extensions.config.js`) | v2 (`config.js`)                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extension `ENABLED` flags   | Features are always included; toggle visibility via config sections |
| `PREFERENCE_BOUND` config   | `PREFERENCE_BOUND` section                                          |
| `TARGET_CUSTOMIZER` config  | `TARGET_CUSTOMIZER` section                                         |
| `SQUIGLINK` config          | `SQUIGLINK` section                                                 |

### New Config Sections

v2 adds several new configuration sections to `config.js` that didn't exist in v1:

| Section    | Purpose                                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SAMPLES`  | Sample-set defaults: run count, display set (`avg`/`curves`/`fill`), fill opacity |
| `CDN_MODE` | Optional CDN deployment settings (version pinning, custom base URL)               |

These are all optional — v2 ships with sensible defaults if you omit them. The [Config Editor](/config-generator) can help you build a complete `config.js` from scratch or review all available options.

## New Capabilities

Beyond the rewrite itself, v2 introduces capabilities that weren't available in v1:

- **CDN deployment** — Serve app code from jsDelivr while keeping your data and config local. New versions update automatically without re-uploading files. See the [CDN deployment guide](./guide-for-admins/deployment/cdn.mdx).
- **Sample sets** — Any variant measured more than once — repeat runs, seating positions, one measurement per ear pad — drawn as an averaged curve, per-run curves, a min/max variance band, or any combination. v1's separate multi-sample and HpTF concepts are now one thing, declared per variant in [`variants[]`](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx#sample-sets). The old `hptfs[]` key still loads but is [deprecated](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx#deprecated-hptfs).
- **Interactive EQ** — Create and adjust EQ filters directly on the graph. Click to add a peaking filter, drag to change frequency and gain, scroll to adjust Q, and double-click to remove. The graph shows the EQ response curve and a ghost of the original FR in real-time.
- **Configurable graph aspect ratio** — Choose between 16:9 or CrinGraph-style proportions via `VISUALIZATION.ASPECT_RATIO`.
- **Native squig.link integration** — Cross-site search, sponsor banner, shop links, and multi-GA4 analytics are built in and activate automatically on `*.squig.link` domains. No more `squigsites.js` script tag.
- **Device PEQ (hardware EQ)** — USB-connected hardware EQ devices (via WebHID/WebSerial) are supported out of the box.
- **Unified theming** — A single `theme.css` drives both the D3 graph and the surrounding UI, with automatic light/dark mode. The [Theme Generator](/theme-generator) lets you build one visually.
