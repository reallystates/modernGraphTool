This page is the step-by-step checklist for moving an existing modernGraphTool v1 database to v2.

:::tip[Looking for the highlights?]
For a feature-level overview of what's different, see [What's New in v2](./whats-new-in-v2.mdx). This page stays focused on the migration procedure.

## Compatibility

**Your existing data works as-is.** The folder structure and file formats are unchanged:

- `phone_book.json` — same structure, same location (`data/phone_book.json`)
- FR measurement files — same `.txt` format in `data/phones/`
- Target curve files — same `.txt` format in `data/target/`
- Preference Bound files — `Bounds U.txt` / `Bounds D.txt` still `.txt`, but their location changed (see [Migration Steps](#migration-steps) below — moved from v1's `extensions/preference-bound/data/` to `data/`)

`config.js` retains the same general structure. All v1 settings (`INITIAL_PHONES`, `INITIAL_TARGETS`, `NORMALIZATION`, `VISUALIZATION`, `INTERFACE`, `PATH`, `WATERMARK`, `TARGET_MANIFEST`, etc.) remain compatible. v2 adds a few optional new sections — see [What's New in v2](./whats-new-in-v2.mdx#new-config-sections).

Deployment is also the same — v2 outputs a fully static SPA to `dist/`. Copy the folder to your web server. The `.htaccess` file for Apache SPA fallback is included.

## Migration Steps

1. **Download** the [latest v2 release](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/releases).
2. **Copy your data** — Move your `data/` folder (phones, targets, `phone_book.json`) into the v2 release folder.
3. **Move Preference Bound data files** — In v1, `Bounds U.txt` and `Bounds D.txt` lived in `extensions/preference-bound/data/`. In v2 they must sit directly in `data/`, alongside `phones/` and `target/`. If you skip this, the Preference Bound overlay will silently fail to render when enabled. The base DF target file (e.g. `KEMAR DF (KB006x) Target.txt`) should already be in `data/target/` as part of step 2.
4. **Migrate `config.js`** — Copy your v1 `config.js` settings into the v2 `config.js` template. The core settings are the same; review the [new sections](./whats-new-in-v2.mdx#new-config-sections) (`SQUIGLINK`, `TARGET_CUSTOMIZER`, `PREFERENCE_BOUND`, `SAMPLES`, `CDN_MODE`) and adjust as needed. The old `MULTI_SAMPLE` and `HPTF` sections are still read for compatibility, but `SAMPLES` replaces both — convert them while you are here. You can use the [Config Editor](/config-generator) to easily migrate and review all settings; it does the `SAMPLES` conversion for you.
5. **Migrate `theme.css`** — If you customized `theme.css`, port your color values to the v2 format (CSS custom properties for graph styling, plus OKLCH-based UI variables). The [Theme Generator](/theme-generator) can help.
6. **Migrate page metadata (`index.html`)** — v2 ships with its own `index.html`, so any edits you made to your v1 `index.html` do **not** carry over automatically. Re-apply them in the v2 `index.html`:
   - `<title>` and `<meta name="title">`
   - `<meta name="description">` and `<meta name="keywords">`
   - Open Graph tags: `<meta property="og:title">`, `<meta property="og:description">`, `<meta property="og:url">`, `<meta property="og:image">`
   - `<link rel="canonical">`
   - Favicons: `<link rel="icon">`, `<link rel="shortcut icon">`, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">`
   - `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title">`
   - Web app manifest: `<link rel="manifest">` (if you had one)

   The [Customizing the Page → Changing Page Metadata](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#changing-page-metadata-indexhtml) section has the field-by-field reference.

   :::note[Source builders]
   If you build from source, edit `src/app.html` instead of `index.html`. The output `dist/index.html` is generated from that template.
   :::

7. **Delete extensions** — The `extensions/` folder is no longer used. Any extension settings should now be in `config.js`.
8. **Test locally** — Open the page in a browser and verify your data loads correctly.

## Picking a Deployment Option

v1 shipped only as a pre-built drop. v2 keeps that as the **[Pre-built Release](./guide-for-admins/deployment/prebuilt.mdx)** — the one-for-one replacement for your v1 setup, with no `BASE_PATH` to set — and adds CDN deployment (recommended: the app bundle loads from jsDelivr and updates itself), GitHub Pages, and building from source. [Choosing a Deployment](./guide-for-admins/setup-env.mdx) compares all four.

### If you pick CDN mode, watch out for `BASE_PATH`

In v2 CDN mode, any deployment **not** at the root of its (sub)domain requires `CDN_MODE.BASE_PATH` in `config.js`. Without it, the home page loads fine but every share link 404s. The fix is one config line. For a site at `example.com/headphones/`:

```javascript
CDN_MODE: {
  MAJOR_VERSION: 2,
  BASE_PATH: "/headphones",
},
```

Full explanation and worked examples: [Why `BASE_PATH` is almost always required](./guide-for-admins/deployment/cdn.mdx#why-base_path-is-almost-always-required).

**squig.link operators** typically run two instances on the same subdomain: `<username>.squig.link/` for earphones (at the subdomain root — no `BASE_PATH`) and `<username>.squig.link/headphones/` for headphones (needs `BASE_PATH: "/headphones"`). Each instance has its own `config.js`, so set `BASE_PATH` only on the `/headphones/` one. The root earphones instance stays as-is.

**Personal databases** under a subdirectory like `example.com/headphones/` need `BASE_PATH` to match. A database at `example.com/` (domain root) does not.

### Switching between CDN and pre-built later

Everything that isn't the app bundle itself (data, config, theme, Preference Bound files) is identical between the two options. You can switch back and forth by swapping your `index.html` file and optionally adding or removing the `CDN_MODE` section from `config.js`. There's no lock-in.
