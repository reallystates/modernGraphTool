Deployments hosted on a `*.squig.link` domain get a few network-wide features on top of the usual ones. They switch on automatically there and stay dormant on any other host.

- **Shop links** — when a loaded device has an entry in the squig.link shop database, a **Buy Now** button links to the sponsor's listing.
- **Sponsor banner** — a sponsor dialog on a visitor's first visit, with content served by the squig.link network.
- **Analytics** — Google Analytics 4 (gtag.js), sending to several measurement IDs at once so a site can report both to squig.link and to its own property.

Each can be switched off, and the analytics IDs set, under [`SQUIGLINK`](../guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#squiglink) in `config.js`.

:::note[Cross-site search and the site selector work anywhere]
Cross-site search used to be squig.link-only. It and the site selector now run on any host, each with its own config section — see [Cross-Site Search](./cross-site-search.mdx) and [Site Selector](./site-selector.mdx). On squig.link, cross-site search still falls back to crawling each site's `phone_book.json` if the aggregate index can't be reached.
