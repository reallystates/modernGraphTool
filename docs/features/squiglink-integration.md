A built-in integration feature that connects modernGraphTool with the squig.link service.

## Overview

The squig.link Integration enhances modernGraphTool by providing seamless integration with the squig.link ecosystem. It enables shop links, analytics tracking, and sponsor banners.

:::note
squig.link features are only active when modernGraphTool is hosted on \*.squig.link domains.

## Features

- **Shop Links**: Display "Buy Now" links for devices with matching shop entries
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics integration with multi-measurement-ID support
- **Sponsor Banners**: Display sponsor content on first visit
- **Configurable Options**: Flexible configuration for different deployment scenarios

## Configuration

squig.link Integration is configured in `config.js`:

```javascript
// In config.js
SQUIGLINK: {
    ENABLED: true,
    ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_IDS: [],
    ANALYTICS_SITE: "",
    LOG_ANALYTICS: true,
    ENABLE_ANALYTICS: true,
    ENABLE_CROSS_SITE_SEARCH: true,
    ENABLE_SPONSOR: true,
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`ENABLED`**: Master toggle for all squig.link features
- **`ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_IDS`**: Array of Google Analytics 4 measurement IDs for multi-tag support
- **`ANALYTICS_SITE`**: Site name used for analytics event attribution
- **`LOG_ANALYTICS`**: Log analytics events to console for debugging
- **`ENABLE_ANALYTICS`**: Toggle analytics tracking on or off
- **`ENABLE_CROSS_SITE_SEARCH`**: Deprecated — use `CROSS_SITE_SEARCH.ENABLED` instead. Still read as a fallback for existing configs.
- **`ENABLE_SPONSOR`**: Toggle sponsor banner display

:::note[Cross-site search moved]
Cross-site device search is no longer a squig.link-only feature — it now works on any host and is
configured under its own `CROSS_SITE_SEARCH` section. See [Cross-Site Search](./cross-site-search.mdx).

On squig.link deployments it still falls back to crawling each site's `phone_book.json` if the
aggregate index can't be reached.

## Usage

### Cross-site Search

Search for headphone measurements across all participating squig.link sites. Results link directly to the matching site's graph tool with the device loaded.

### Shop Links

When a loaded device has a matching entry in the squig.link shop links database, a "Buy Now" button is displayed linking to the sponsor.

### Analytics

When enabled, user interactions are tracked via Google Analytics 4 (gtag.js) for site usage insights.

### Sponsor Banners

On first visit, a sponsor dialog may be displayed with content loaded from the squig.link network.
