Device PEQ reads and writes parametric EQ directly on supported audio hardware — DACs, dongles, streamers and some headphones — from the browser, with no extra software. Once written, the EQ lives in the device's own memory and keeps working away from the computer.

It sits at the bottom of the Equalizer panel. For the workflow, see [Equalizing audio](../guide-for-users/equalizing.mdx#device-peq--push-eq-to-hardware).

## Connections

| Connection    | Browser API   | Examples                                              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **USB HID**   | WebHID        | FiiO, Moondrop and KTMicro dongles, DAC/amps          |
| **USB Serial** | Web Serial    | JDS Labs, Nothing, EarFun, and more                   |
| **Bluetooth** | Web Bluetooth | Select FiiO and Airoha-chipset devices                |
| **Network**   | —             | IP-addressable devices such as WiiM streamers and Luxsin X9 |

The full, current device list is in the **About Device PEQ** dialog inside the panel (**New to Device PEQ?**).

## Browser support

Device PEQ needs a Chromium-based browser — **Chrome, Edge or Opera**. Firefox and Safari implement none of WebHID, Web Serial or Web Bluetooth, so the panel shows a compatibility notice there instead of the connect buttons.

## Pushing and pulling

- **Push** writes the current filter list to the device, into the selected slot on devices that have several.
- **Pull** reads the device's current filters into the filter list and turns the Equalizer on.

While a device is connected, its limits — band count, gain range, and whether it accepts shelf filters — become the active EQ constraint, so hand edits and AutoEQ produce something the device can hold. A 5-band device gets a 5-band AutoEQ.

:::note[Shared bands only]
Hardware EQ slots have no channel concept. A push sends the **L+R** bands and tells you how many left- or right-only bands it skipped — see [Per-channel EQ](./equalizer.mdx#per-channel-eq).
