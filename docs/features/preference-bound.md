An advanced visualization feature that displays preference boundaries on frequency response graphs, helping users understand the acceptable variation ranges in FR.

## Overview

The Preference Bound feature adds a sophisticated overlay to modernGraphTool that visualizes preference boundaries around target curves.

These boundaries represent the statistically acceptable range of frequency response variations that most listeners find pleasant, based on research data and listening preferences.

## Features

- **Preference Bound**: Display upper and lower preference bounds
- **Customizable Appearance**: Adjustable colors, transparency, and styling
- **Target Integration**: Works with diffuse field targets for accurate baseline reference

## Configuration

Preference Bound is configured in `config.js`:

```javascript
// In config.js
PREFERENCE_BOUND: {
    ENABLE_BOUND_ON_INITIAL_LOAD: false,
    BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE: "KEMAR DF (KB006x) Target",
    COLOR_FILL: "rgba(180,180,180,0.2)",
    COLOR_BORDER: "rgba(120,120,120,0.5)",
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`ENABLE_BOUND_ON_INITIAL_LOAD`**: Whether to show boundaries when modernGraphTool first loads
- **`BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE`**: File name (without `.txt` extension) of the diffuse field target used as the baseline for boundary calculations. The file must already exist in your configured target folder — the preference bound loader reads it directly from `PATH.TARGET_MEASUREMENT`, so no duplicate copy is needed.
- **`COLOR_FILL`**: RGBA color for the filled boundary area
- **`COLOR_BORDER`**: RGBA color for the boundary outline

:::note[Base target location]
The base DF target file is resolved from the same folder your other target curves live in, defined by `PATH.TARGET_MEASUREMENT` in `config.js`. See the [`PATH`](../guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#path) config section.

## Data File Format

### Boundary Data Files

The feature requires two boundary data files in the `data/` directory (alongside `phones/` and `target/`):

#### Upper Boundary (`Bounds U.txt`)

Contains frequency response data for the upper preference boundary:

```
20.0	2.5
25.0	2.8
31.5	3.1
...
```

#### Lower Boundary (`Bounds D.txt`)

Contains frequency response data for the lower preference boundary:

```
20.0	-2.5
25.0	-2.8
31.5	-3.1
...
```

#### Base Target File

The base DF target file is **resolved from `PATH.TARGET_MEASUREMENT`** in `config.js` — the same folder where every other target curve lives (default: `./data/target/`). You do **not** need to duplicate the target file into another folder; the preference bound loader reads it directly from the regular target directory using the file name you set in `PREFERENCE_BOUND.BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE`.

For example, `BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE: "KEMAR DF (KB006x) Target"` will load `./data/target/KEMAR DF (KB006x) Target.txt` (or whichever path you've configured in `PATH.TARGET_MEASUREMENT`).

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Toggle Control**: Use the toggle button to show/hide boundaries
2. **Target Alignment**: Boundaries automatically align with the selected base target
3. **Real-time Updates**: Boundaries update when changing targets or measurements

### Visual Interpretation

- **Filled Area**: The area between upper and lower bounds represents the preference range
- **Target Baseline**: Boundaries are relative to the selected diffuse field target
- **Measurement Overlay**: Compare headphone measurements against preference boundaries
