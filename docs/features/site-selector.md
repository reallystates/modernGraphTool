A dropdown in the top bar that lists every known measurement database, grouped by rig type, so
visitors can jump straight to another site.

## Overview

Where [Cross-Site Search](./cross-site-search.mdx) answers "who else measured _this device_", the
site selector answers "where else can I go". It lists the databases themselves rather than
individual devices, and highlights the one the visitor is currently on.

This works on **any host** — squig.link is not required. The selector reads a single small
directory document (a few KB), so it costs one cached request per visit.

That document comes from [GAA](https://github.com/potatosalad775/GAA), which merges
[GraphAggregator](https://github.com/HarutoHiroki/GraphAggregator)'s federated index with
squig.link's site registry and publishes just the site and database list — no device corpus.
modernGraphTool ships with its URL built in, so there is nothing to set up.

## Getting your site listed

The selector shows what the shared index knows about. To appear in it:

- **Self-hosted or custom domain** — register at
  [graphaggregator.harutohiroki.com](https://graphaggregator.harutohiroki.com/).
- **Hosted on squig.link** — you are already listed, via squig.link's own registry.

Registering also makes your databases discoverable through cross-site search on every other
deployment, and it is what makes the selector appear on your own site under the default `auto`
setting.

## Configuration

Configured in `config.js`. The section is optional — omit it entirely and the defaults below apply:

```javascript
SITE_SELECTOR: {
    ENABLED: 'auto',
    INDEX_URLS: [],
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`ENABLED`**: When to show the selector.
  - `'auto'` (default) — show it only when this deployment is listed in the index, or is hosted on
    squig.link. A standalone site that isn't registered gets nothing, rather than a dropdown listing
    a hundred other people's databases and none of its own.
  - `true` — always show it.
  - `false` — never show it, and skip the fetch entirely.
- **`INDEX_URLS`**: Directory documents to try, in order. Leave empty to use the official GAA index.

## Self-hosting the index

To avoid depending on a third-party origin, publish your own directory document and point
`INDEX_URLS` at it:

```javascript
SITE_SELECTOR: {
    ENABLED: 'auto',
    INDEX_URLS: [
        'https://example.com/my-site-index.json',
        'https://backup.example.com/my-site-index.json'
    ],
}
```

Each URL is tried in order and the first valid document wins, so a mirror can be listed as a backup.
The document must follow the GAA schema — see the
[GAA repository](https://github.com/potatosalad775/GAA) for the spec and for a build script that
generates it. Forking GAA and pointing this at your fork's GitHub Pages URL is the least-effort
route.

## Notes

- The database the visitor is currently viewing is detected by URL and shown as selected. Longest
  path match wins, so a site hosting `/` and `/headphones/` resolves to the right one.
- Databases that were unreachable when the index was last built stay listed but are dimmed, with a
  tooltip explaining that the link may not work. A site that is briefly down doesn't vanish from
  navigation.
- Entries open in a new tab.
