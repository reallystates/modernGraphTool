Folds every measurement currently on the graph into a single averaged curve, added alongside the originals.

## Overview

The **Average** button sits in the graph toolbar. Pressing it takes the mean of every visible measurement and adds the result as a new curve.

The typical use is combining several measurements of the same model — different units, or the same unit measured by different people — into one representative response to equalize against. Upload or select the measurements, press Average, and the result behaves like any other curve on the graph.

## What gets averaged

Only **measurements that are currently drawn**:

- **Measurements only.** Targets and the EQ curve are never included — averaging a measurement against a target produces a curve that means nothing.
- **Hidden curves are skipped.** Use the eye icon in the selection list to exclude a measurement without removing it.
- **Uploaded measurements count.** A file you dragged in participates exactly like one from the database, which is the main reason the feature exists.
- **Only the channels you are showing.** A device displayed as its left/right pair contributes to the L and R averages; one displayed as an average contributes to the AVG average. Each channel is averaged over its own set of contributors.

The button stays disabled until at least two measurements are visible.

## Working with the result

The averaged curve is a normal inserted curve, so everything you can do with an uploaded measurement works on it:

- Recolor it, hide it, or remove it from the selection list
- Use it as the EQ source in the Equalizer panel
- Set it as the graph baseline
- Download it as a `.txt` measurement file
- Undo the whole thing in one step

Its name carries the number of measurements that went into it, for example **Average (of 3)**.

:::note[The average is a snapshot]
It is calculated once, at the moment you press the button. Adding, removing or hiding a measurement afterwards does **not** update it — press Average again to build a new one. The contributor count in the name tells you how many curves the existing one was built from.

:::caution[Averaged curves are not saved in share links]
Like uploaded measurements, an averaged curve exists only in your browser session. A `?share=` link will not carry it, and reloading the page clears it.
