The Equalizer panel is a parametric EQ that works on loaded measurements: Peaking, Low Shelf and High Shelf bands with automatic preamp, AutoEQ against any target, per-channel bands, an in-browser audio preview, and filter import/export. [Device PEQ](./device-peq.mdx) pushes the result to hardware.

This page covers the behavior worth knowing in detail. For a walkthrough of the panel, see [Equalizing audio](../guide-for-users/equalizing.mdx); operators can set defaults under [`EQUALIZER`](../guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#equalizer).

## The Equalizer toggle

Nothing in the panel reaches the graph or the audio player until the master **Equalizer** switch at
the top of the panel is on. Actions that only make sense with EQ live turn it on for you:

- Importing a filter file
- Running AutoEQ
- Pulling filters from a connected device (Device PEQ)
- Adding the **first** band to an empty filter list

Editing bands you already have does not touch the switch. Turning EQ off to compare against the raw
curve while you tweak is a deliberate workflow — hold <kbd>\\</kbd> for a momentary A/B flip in
either direction — so nothing re-enables it under you.

## Per-channel EQ

At the top of the filter list is a **Channel** switch with three positions — **L+R**, **L** and **R**.
It chooses which bands the list below is editing:

- **L+R** — shared bands. They apply to both ears, which is how every EQ behaved before this
  existed, and it preserves whatever channel imbalance the unit has.
- **L** / **R** — bands for that ear alone, stacked on top of the shared ones.

The count beside each label is how many bands live in that bucket. While scoped to one ear the list
shows only that ear's bands, with a line underneath reporting how many shared bands also reach it.
A band's **Applies to** control (expand the band to see it) moves it between buckets.

What each ear actually plays is *shared + that ear's own bands*. The preamp is a single number sized
for whichever ear needs the most headroom, and the on-graph average is recomputed as the mean of the
two equalized channels — so a left-only correction visibly moves the average too.

Two things to know:

- **AutoEQ follows the switch.** In **L+R** it optimizes against the average, preserving the unit's
  natural imbalance. Scoped to one ear it optimizes against that ear's measurement and replaces only
  that bucket, leaving the shared bands and the other ear alone. Running it once per ear is how you
  correct imbalance and match a target at the same time.
- **Device PEQ is shared-only.** Hardware EQ slots have no channel concept, so pushing to a device
  sends the shared bands and warns you about the left/right bands it had to skip. The graph, the
  audio preview and file export all carry the full per-channel EQ.

See [Equalizing audio](../guide-for-users/equalizing.mdx#per-channel-eq-l--r) for the workflow.

## AutoEQ band count

**Run AutoEQ** generates as many bands as the filter list already holds, so adding five bands before
running is how you ask for a five-band result. With an empty list it falls back to **8** bands.

Operators can change that fallback with `EQUALIZER.AUTOEQ_DEFAULT_BAND_COUNT` — see
[Customizing the Page](../guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#equalizer). Either way, the active
constraint preset's band cap wins: a connected 5-band device gets 5, and a preset with no cap at
all is held to 32.

The count is the total. With **Use shelf filters** on, two of those bands are the low and high
shelf: ten bands is eight peaking filters plus the pair. Below four bands the shelves are dropped,
because spending the whole budget on them corrects nothing but overall tilt.

## Auto-apply

Once a run lands, **Run AutoEQ** becomes **Recalculate**, and the **Auto-apply** switch beside it
keeps the result current. While it is on, AutoEQ runs again whenever the source or target curve
changes — a tilt or bass shelf from the target customizer, say — or when an AutoEQ option does.
Switching it on runs once straight away.

- It re-runs with the band count and channel it was switched on with. Scoping the list to one ear
  doesn't change what it fits; to change the band count, add or remove bands and press
  **Recalculate**.
- The re-runs fold into one undo entry, so a single undo returns to the filters from before AutoEQ.
- An auto-applied run leaves the Equalizer toggle alone, so you can switch EQ off to compare while
  nudging the target.
- It keeps running from other panels, which is how you tilt a target in the Graph panel and watch
  the EQ follow.

It switches itself off, and says why, rather than overwrite something it can no longer vouch for:

- the filters are edited by hand — adding, removing or dragging a band, undo, import, or a History &
  Compare switch;
- a different source device or target is selected, or the target is removed;
- the EQ preset changes;
- the fallback optimizer answered (see [The optimizer](#the-optimizer)). It is too slow to follow
  every change, so the switch stays unavailable until a run succeeds with turboEQ.

## The optimizer

AutoEQ runs [turboEQ](https://github.com/potatosalad775/turboEQ), a WebAssembly port of
[AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq)'s optimizer, which fits every filter at once. A
run with the default eight bands takes a few milliseconds, over a hundred times faster than the
optimizer it replaced, and returns exactly the bands it was asked for. See
[AutoEQ Benchmarks](./autoeq-benchmarks.mdx) for measurements against CrinGraph and AutoEq itself.

### Fit mode

**Exact match** is the default. It fits the curve the way the graph shows it: the full shape up to
20 kHz, with bands allowed anywhere in the frequency range. Narrow, deep bands are allowed when the
curve calls for them, up to the Q range you set.

**Treble-safe** is jaakkopasanen AutoEQ's own, more cautious fit. AutoEq smooths the treble above about 8 kHz, judges
only its overall level above 10 kHz and places no band above 10 kHz. Treble measurements can vary a lot depending
on a fit, seating, and physical characteristic of every rig, so this corrects only what a measurement can be trusted for. 
Choose it when you don't trust your treble data, or when the EQ is for listening rather than for matching the exact graph.

In either mode, the gain range's maximum caps the largest boost the whole EQ may apply, not only
each band. The preamp follows automatically, so a bigger boost costs loudness rather than clipping.
Lower the maximum if you would rather keep the level up.

The frequency, Q and gain ranges are **bounds the fit works within**, exactly as you set them, not
a clamp applied to the result afterwards: narrowing them changes what the optimizer looks for rather
than trimming what it found. The frequency range says where a band may sit — the fit is still judged across the whole
axis, so a narrow range leaves the rest of the curve alone instead of pretending it is already
correct.

With **Use shelf filters** on, the fit places the low and high shelf itself, choosing their
frequency and Q as well as their gain. Shelf Q stays between 0.4 and 0.7, since a steeper shelf
overshoots into a bump that a peaking band does better.

Graphic-EQ presets fit too. Frequency and Q come from the preset's own bands and only gain is
optimized, so every band lands exactly on its slider.

If the module cannot load for any reason, the older JavaScript optimizer answers instead, and the
AutoEQ panel says so. It is slower and fits less well, and it sometimes returns fewer bands than 
it was asked for, but a failed load never costs you a working AutoEQ. It has only one way to fit,
the same as Exact match, so the fit mode is hidden until turboEQ loads again. It cannot keep bands
on a graphic EQ's sliders, so with a graphic-EQ preset AutoEQ leaves the filters as they are and
says why.

turboEQ can also turn down a particular request while loading fine — Treble-safe with a frequency
range entirely above 10 kHz, for example, since that mode places no band there. The older optimizer
answers that request too, and the panel says the settings were the problem; the fit mode stays, so
you can switch to Exact match.
