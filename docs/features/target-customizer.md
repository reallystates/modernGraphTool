The Target Customizer lets visitors reshape a target curve to their own taste with a handful of filter sliders — tilt, bass, treble, ear gain — and one-click presets such as the Harman 2013, 2015 and 2018 tunings. Adjustments sit on top of the original target: the file on disk never changes, and the adjusted curve is carried in share links.

Customizable targets show a sliders icon in their selection-list row. For the walkthrough, see [Targets and preferences](../guide-for-users/targets-and-preferences.mdx#customizing-a-target).

## Filter types

Each slider is one filter, defined by the operator with a type, a frequency and a Q:

| Type   | Shape                                         | Typical use                        |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `TILT` | Linear gain change across the whole spectrum  | Overall warmth or brightness       |
| `LSQ`  | Low shelf below the corner frequency          | Bass boost or cut                  |
| `HSQ`  | High shelf above the corner frequency         | Treble brightness                  |
| `PK`   | Peaking filter centred on the frequency       | Ear-gain region, a specific band   |

The default set is **Tilt**, **Bass** (`LSQ`, 105 Hz), **Treble** (`HSQ`, 2.5 kHz) and **Ear** (`PK`, 2.75 kHz).

## What operators control

All of it is set under [`TARGET_CUSTOMIZER`](../guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#target_customizer) in `config.js`:

- **Which targets are customizable.** Only targets listed in `CUSTOMIZABLE_TARGETS` get the sliders, so reference targets can stay locked.
- **The filters.** `FILTERS` defines the sliders. Setting it **replaces** the default set rather than extending it.
- **The presets.** `FILTER_PRESET` maps preset names to slider values.
- **Initial adjustments.** `INITIAL_TARGET_FILTERS` applies slider values to a target as soon as it loads, so a deployment can ship its preferred variant of a target by default.
