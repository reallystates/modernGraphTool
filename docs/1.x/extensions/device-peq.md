A modernGraphTool-compatible wrapper for the devicePEQ project, enabling direct integration with hardware equalizers and audio devices.

## Overview

The Device PEQ extension integrates the powerful [devicePEQ plugin by jeromeof][DEVICEPEQ] into modernGraphTool, allowing users to send equalizer settings directly to compatible audio devices.

This extension provides a bridge between modernGraphTool's measurement analysis capabilities and real-world audio device control.

## Features

- **Hardware Integration**: Direct connection to compatible audio devices
- **Device Management**: Connect, disconnect, and manage multiple audio devices
- **PEQ Slot Management**: Manage parametric EQ slots on supported devices
- **Real-time Sync**: Synchronize EQ settings between modernGraphTool and hardware
- **Advanced Controls**: Optional advanced device manipulation features
