This page frames the setup decision and points you at the right deployment option. Each option has its own dedicated guide linked from the table below.

## Prerequisites

1.  **modernGraphTool project files** — either a [pre-built release](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/releases) or a clone of the source repository, depending on which deployment option you pick.
2.  **Text editor** — for modifying `config.js`, `theme.css`, and other configuration files. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for its syntax highlighting and auto-completion.

Neither is required for the [GitHub Pages](./deployment/github-pages.mdx) option, which starts from a template repository and is edited in the browser.

## Deployment Options

modernGraphTool supports four deployment paths. The first question is whether you already have a web server — if not, GitHub Pages gives you one for free. After that, pick based on how much control you need over updates and customization:

| Option                                               | Best for                       | Updates                   | Customization                      | Subdirectory hosting                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **[GitHub Pages](./deployment/github-pages.mdx)**        | Operators without hosting      | Automatic                 | Config, theme, data, HTML metadata | Handled automatically                  |
| **[CDN Deployment](./deployment/cdn.mdx)** (recommended) | Most operators                 | Automatic                 | Config, theme, data                | Requires one config line (`BASE_PATH`) |
| **[Pre-built Release](./deployment/prebuilt.mdx)**       | Controlled rollouts, airgapped | Manual (re-download)      | Config, theme, data, HTML metadata | Works out of the box                   |
| **[Building from Source](./deployment/from-source.mdx)** | Developers, forks              | Manual (git pull + build) | Everything                         | Works out of the box                   |

### [GitHub Pages](./deployment/github-pages.mdx)

Free hosting from GitHub, set up entirely in your browser — no server, no FTP, and nothing to install. You copy a [template repository](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool_site) that already contains a working site, switch Pages on, and replace the demo measurements with your own. Under the hood it's CDN deployment, so updates are automatic and the `BASE_PATH` problem below is solved for you.

Note that this requires a public repository, so it isn't an option for a private database.

### [CDN Deployment](./deployment/cdn.mdx)

Your server hosts only a minimal `index.html` loader plus your `config.js`, `theme.css`, `data/`, and `assets/`. The application code itself comes from jsDelivr and auto-updates when new versions ship. This is the simplest path — no manual updates, no re-uploads.

If your site lives under a subdirectory like `/headphones/` (common on squig.link, where operators often run a root earphones database plus a `/headphones/` headphones database on the same subdomain), you'll need to set `CDN_MODE.BASE_PATH` in your config — it's a one-line change, but easy to miss. See the [CDN deployment guide](./deployment/cdn.mdx#why-base_path-is-almost-always-required) for details.

### [Pre-built Release](./deployment/prebuilt.mdx)

Download a full `dist/` folder and upload it to your server. You control exactly which version runs and when it changes — no runtime dependency on jsDelivr, works in airgapped environments, subdirectory hosting works without any extra config. The tradeoff is that updating to a new release means re-downloading and re-uploading.

### [Building from Source](./deployment/from-source.mdx)

Clone the repository, customize anything you like, and build your own `dist/` folder. This is the developer path — use it if you need changes that go beyond what `config.js` exposes.

## Installing a Text Editor

While various text editors are available, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for its convenient features like code highlighting and auto-completion.

VS Code can be downloaded for free by anyone and supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

1.  Go to the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download the installer for your operating system, and install it.
2.  Open the modernGraphTool project folder (or the extracted release folder) in VS Code.
3.  You can now edit configuration files and manage your data.
