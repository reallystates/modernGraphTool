modernGraphTool supports four deployment paths. The first question is whether you already have a web server — if not, GitHub Pages gives you one for free. After that, pick based on how much control you need over updates and customization:

| Option                                                   | Best for                       | Updates                   | Customization                      | Subdirectory hosting                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **[GitHub Pages](./deployment/github-pages.mdx)**        | Operators without hosting      | Automatic                 | Config, theme, data, HTML metadata | Handled automatically                  |
| **[CDN Deployment](./deployment/cdn.mdx)** (recommended) | Most operators                 | Automatic                 | Config, theme, data                | Requires one config line (`BASE_PATH`) |
| **[Pre-built Release](./deployment/prebuilt.mdx)**       | Controlled rollouts, airgapped | Manual (re-download)      | Config, theme, data, HTML metadata | Works out of the box                   |
| **[Building from Source](./deployment/from-source.mdx)** | Developers, forks              | Manual (git pull + build) | Everything                         | Works out of the box                   |

Everything that isn't the app bundle itself — data, config, theme — is identical across the options, so switching later is a matter of swapping `index.html`, not redoing your database.

## [GitHub Pages](./deployment/github-pages.mdx)

Free hosting from GitHub, set up entirely in your browser — no server, no FTP, and nothing to install. You copy a [template repository](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool_site) that already contains a working site, switch Pages on, and replace the demo measurements with your own. Under the hood it's CDN deployment, so updates are automatic and the `BASE_PATH` problem below is solved for you.

This requires a public repository, so it isn't an option for a private database.

## [CDN Deployment](./deployment/cdn.mdx)

Your server hosts only a minimal `index.html` loader plus your `config.js`, `theme.css`, `data/`, and `assets/`. The application code itself comes from jsDelivr and auto-updates when new versions ship. This is the simplest path — no manual updates, no re-uploads.

If your site lives under a subdirectory like `/headphones/` (common on squig.link, where operators often run a root earphones database plus a `/headphones/` headphones database on the same subdomain), you'll need to set `CDN_MODE.BASE_PATH` in your config — it's a one-line change, but easy to miss. See the [CDN deployment guide](./deployment/cdn.mdx#why-base_path-is-almost-always-required) for details.

## [Pre-built Release](./deployment/prebuilt.mdx)

Download a full `dist/` folder and upload it to your server. You control exactly which version runs and when it changes — no runtime dependency on jsDelivr, works in airgapped environments, subdirectory hosting works without any extra config. The tradeoff is that updating to a new release means re-downloading and re-uploading.

## [Building from Source](./deployment/from-source.mdx)

Clone the repository, customize anything you like, and build your own `dist/` folder. This is the developer path — use it if you need changes that go beyond what `config.js` exposes.

## What you'll need

Apart from GitHub Pages, which is edited in the browser, every option needs:

1. **The project files** — a [release](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/releases) or a clone of the repository, depending on the option.
2. **A text editor** for `config.js`, `theme.css` and `phone_book.json`. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is free on Windows, macOS and Linux, and highlights mistakes as you type.

The [Config Editor](/config-generator), [phone_book.json Editor](/phone-book-editor) and [Theme Generator](/theme-generator) cover most edits without hand-writing any of these files.
