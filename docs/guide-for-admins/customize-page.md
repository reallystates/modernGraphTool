import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can change the initial display content, design theme, etc., of the modernGraphTool page to suit your needs.

You will primarily personalize the page by editing `index.html`, `theme.css`, and `config.js` — in that order, from simplest to most involved.

:::note[File Locations]

- **Pre-built release users**: These files are in the root of your extracted release folder.
- **Source builders**: Default configuration and data files are in the `defaults/` folder. The HTML entry point is `src/app.html`. After building (`npm run build`), everything is output to `dist/`.
  :::

## Changing Page Metadata (`index.html`)

The `index.html` file defines the basic HTML structure and metadata for modernGraphTool — the page title, description, preview image, favicon, and other `<head>` fields picked up by browsers and social media scrapers.

:::note[File Location]

- **Pre-built release**: Edit `index.html` directly in your release folder.
- **Source builders**: Edit `src/app.html` (SvelteKit template). After building, the output `dist/index.html` is generated from this template.
  :::

:::caution[Caution]
The HTML file follows HTML syntax. You must check for syntax errors after modification.
:::

### `TITLE`

```html
<title>modernGraphTool</title>
<meta name="title" content="modernGraphTool" />
<meta property="og:title" content="modernGraphTool" />
```

Sets the page title.

### `DESCRIPTION`

```html
<meta
	name="description"
	content="View and compare frequency response graphs for earphones/headphones."
/>
<meta
	property="og:description"
	content="View and compare frequency response graphs for earphones/headphones."
/>
```

Sets the page description.

### `KEYWORDS`

Sets the page keywords (used for search engine optimization).

```html
<meta
	name="keywords"
	content="earphone,headphone,IEM,frequency response,graph,comparison,measurement,FR"
/>
```

### `URL` / `LINK`

Sets the page URL and link.

```html
<meta property="og:url" content="/?" /> <link rel="canonical" href="/?" />
```

### `IMAGE`

Sets the page preview image.

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="/preview.png" />
```

:::tip[Tip]
Images used in modernGraphTool can be located in any path, but it is recommended to place them in the `assets/images` folder.
:::

### `FAVICON`

Sets the page favicon (tab icon).

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon.png" />
```

:::tip[Tip]
Images used in modernGraphTool can be located in any path, but it is recommended to place them in the `assets/images` folder.
:::

## Customizing Page Styles (`theme.css`)

The `theme.css` file contains CSS custom properties (variables) that drive modernGraphTool's visual theme — both the D3.js frequency response graph and the surrounding UI chrome. All variables switch automatically between light and dark mode.

:::tip[Generate a theme visually]
The docs site ships a live **[Theme Generator](/theme-generator)** that lets you pick colors, preview the graph and UI in both light and dark mode, and download a ready-to-drop `theme.css` file. Use it if you don't want to hand-edit the CSS variables below.
:::

:::tip[Tip]
The `theme.css` file should be co-located with `index.html` at the root of your deployment.
:::

### Graph Variables

These drive the SVG rendering where Tailwind classes cannot be used:

```css
:root {
	--color-graph-bg: transparent; /* Graph background */
	--color-graph-watermark-opacity: 0.08; /* Watermark opacity */
	--color-graph-grid-major: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); /* Major grid lines */
	--color-graph-grid-minor: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06); /* Minor grid lines */
	--color-graph-axis-label: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); /* Axis labels (Hz, dB) */
	--color-graph-grid-text: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Grid value labels */
	--color-graph-baseline: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); /* Baseline indicator */
}

.dark {
	--color-graph-grid-major: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
	--color-graph-grid-minor: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
	--color-graph-axis-label: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
	--color-graph-grid-text: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
	--color-graph-baseline: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25);
}
```

### Base UI Variables

The UI chrome — backgrounds, text, buttons, accents — is driven by a DaisyUI-style base palette. Every variable has a light (`:root`) and dark (`.dark`) value:

```css
:root {
	--color-base-100: oklch(98% 0.003 247.858); /* Background */
	--color-base-200: oklch(96% 0.007 247.896); /* Elevated surface */
	--color-base-300: oklch(92% 0.013 255.508); /* Highest surface */
	--color-base-content: oklch(20% 0.042 265.755); /* Default text */
	--color-primary: oklch(59% 0.145 163.225); /* Primary accent */
	--color-primary-content: oklch(97% 0.021 166.113);
	--color-secondary: oklch(60% 0.126 221.723);
	--color-secondary-content: oklch(98% 0.019 200.873);
	--color-accent: oklch(44% 0.017 285.786);
	--color-accent-content: oklch(98% 0 0);
	--color-neutral: oklch(44% 0.043 257.281);
	--color-neutral-content: oklch(98% 0.003 247.858);
	--color-info: oklch(68% 0.169 237.323);
	--color-info-content: oklch(97% 0.013 236.62);
	--color-success: oklch(76% 0.233 130.85);
	--color-success-content: oklch(98% 0.031 120.757);
	--color-warning: oklch(79% 0.184 86.047);
	--color-warning-content: oklch(98% 0.026 102.212);
	--color-error: oklch(64% 0.246 16.439);
	--color-error-content: oklch(96% 0.015 12.422);
}
```

Each `--color-*` role has a matching `--color-*-content` variable that sets the foreground (text/icon) color rendered on top of it, so contrast is preserved automatically when you change the base.

:::note[Color format]
Values use the [OKLCH color space](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/oklch). You can still supply `rgb()`, `hsl()`, or hex values if you prefer, but OKLCH gives more predictable perceptual lightness across the palette.
:::

## Changing Basic Settings (`config.js`)

:::tip[Prefer a visual editor?]
The docs site ships a live **[Config Editor](/config-generator)** that lets you build and export a valid `config.js` without hand-editing. It covers every field described below — this reference page is still useful when you want to understand what each field does or tweak an existing file by hand.
:::

The `config.js` file contains various settings related to the operation of modernGraphTool. You can open this file with a text editor and modify the necessary parts.

:::note[Not every option is in the file you downloaded]
The shipped `config.js` is deliberately short. It sets **live values only for the options most deployments change** — everything else is a commented-out stub with a one-line description and a pointer to the section on this page.

An option that is absent or commented out falls back to a built-in default; it does not break. So to switch a feature on, uncomment its stub and fill in what you need — you never have to add a whole section from scratch. This page documents every field either way, including ones not present in the file at all.
:::

:::caution[Caution]
The `config.js` file follows JavaScript syntax. Strings must be enclosed in quotes (`"` or `'`), and a comma (`,`) must be appended to the end of each setting item (except for the last item). You must check for syntax errors after modification.
:::

### `INITIAL_PHONES`

```javascript
// Brand : Sennheiser
// Model : IE200
// Suffix : (Foam Tip)
INITIAL_PHONES: ["Sennheiser IE200 (Foam Tip)"],

// You can add multiple phones to the list.
INITIAL_PHONES: ["Sennheiser IE200", "Sony IER-Z1R"],
```

Specifies the names of the Phone (measurement data) to be displayed by default when the page loads, in array format.

- You must use the brand + device name defined in `phone_book.json`.
  - The device name to be displayed can include a suffix. If no suffix is specified, the first file will be displayed by default.
- You can choose to display multiple Phones (measurement data).

### `INITIAL_TARGETS`

```javascript
INITIAL_TARGETS: ["Harman IE 2019v2 Target"],

// You can add multiple targets to the list.
INITIAL_TARGETS: ["Harman IE 2019v2 Target", "KEMAR DF Target"],
```

Specifies the names of the Target (target curve) to be displayed by default when the page loads, in array format.

- Use the file names (excluding extension) in the `data/target` folder.

### `INITIAL_PANEL`

```javascript
INITIAL_PANEL: "graph",
```

Specifies the panel to be displayed by default when the page loads.

- You can choose from `phone`, `graph`, `equalizer`, or `misc`.

### `NORMALIZATION`

```javascript
NORMALIZATION: {
  TYPE: "Hz",
  HZ_VALUE: 500,
},
```

Specifies the default settings for graph normalization.

#### `TYPE`

Sets the normalization method.

- You can choose between `Hz (based on a specific frequency)` or `Avg (based on the average of 300~3000Hz)`.

#### `HZ_VALUE`

If `TYPE` is set to 'Hz', the entered number will be used as the default frequency.

### `VISUALIZATION`

```javascript
VISUALIZATION: {
  ASPECT_RATIO: "16:9",
  DEFAULT_Y_SCALE: 60,
  LABEL: {
    LOCATION: "BOTTOM_LEFT",
    POSITION: {
      LEFT: "0", RIGHT: "0", UP: "0", DOWN: "0",
    },
    TEXT_SIZE: "20px",
    TEXT_WEIGHT: "600",
  },
  BASELINE_LABEL: {
    LOCATION: "TOP_LEFT",
    POSITION: {
      LEFT: "0", RIGHT: "0", UP: "0", DOWN: "0",
    },
    TEXT_SIZE: "15px",
    TEXT_WEIGHT: "500",
  },
  RIG_DESCRIPTION: "Measured with IEC 60318-4 (711)",
},
```

Specifies settings related to graph visualization.

#### `ASPECT_RATIO`

Sets the aspect ratio of the frequency response graph.

- `"16:9"` — Standard widescreen (800×450 viewBox).
- `"CrinGraph"` — Matches CrinGraph's proportions (800×346 viewBox).

#### `DEFAULT_Y_SCALE`

Sets the default display range for the Y-axis (dB).

- You can choose from 30, 40, 50, 60, or 80.

#### `LABEL`

Sets the position, size, weight, etc., of the Phone/Target name labels displayed on the graph. Optional — the defaults below produce the layout modernGraphTool ships with, so set this only to move the labels.

- `LOCATION` : Name label position — default `BOTTOM_LEFT`
  - Choose from `BOTTOM_LEFT`, `BOTTOM_RIGHT`, `TOP_LEFT`, `TOP_RIGHT`.
- `POSITION` : Fine-tune name label position — defaults `RIGHT: "44"`, `UP: "43"`, `LEFT: "0"`, `DOWN: "0"`
  - Applied as `x + RIGHT - LEFT` and `y + DOWN - UP`, from whichever corner `LOCATION` anchors to. All four always apply — they are not specific to the chosen corner.
- `TEXT_SIZE` : Name label size (in px) — default `"14px"`.
- `TEXT_WEIGHT` : Name label weight (choose a multiple of 100 from 100 to 900) — default `"600"`.

#### `BASELINE_LABEL`

Sets the position, size, weight, etc., of the baseline label displayed on the graph when a baseline (compensation) target is active. Also optional.

- Same options as `LABEL` above, with defaults `LOCATION: "TOP_LEFT"`, `POSITION: { RIGHT: "44", DOWN: "39", LEFT: "0", UP: "0" }`, `TEXT_SIZE: "14px"`, `TEXT_WEIGHT: "500"`.

#### `RIG_DESCRIPTION`

Enter the description of the measurement equipment to be displayed in the upper right corner of the graph.

### `INTERFACE`

```javascript
INTERFACE: {
  PREFERRED_DARK_MODE_THEME: "light",
  PANEL_POSITION: "left",
  ALLOW_REMOVING_PHONE_FROM_SELECTOR: true,
  SWITCH_PHONE_PANEL_ON_BRAND_CLICK: true,
  TARGET: {
    ALLOW_MULTIPLE_LINE_PER_TYPE: true,
    OMIT_TARGET_SUFFIX: true,
    COLLAPSE_TARGET_LIST_ON_INITIAL: true,
  },
  HIDE_DEV_DONATE_BUTTON: false,
},
```

Specifies settings related to the user interface.

#### `PREFERRED_DARK_MODE_THEME`

Specifies the dark mode setting.

- Choose from `light`, `dark`, `system`.

#### `PANEL_POSITION`

Sets which side the menu + panel column appears on in the desktop UI. The mobile UI is unaffected.

- Choose `left` (default — controls on the left, graph on the right; matches the legacy CrinGraph layout) or `right` (graph on the left, controls on the right).

#### `ALLOW_REMOVING_PHONE_FROM_SELECTOR`

Sets whether to remove an already added item from the graph when reselected in the Phone (measurement data) selector.

- Choose `true` or `false`.

#### `SWITCH_PHONE_PANEL_ON_BRAND_CLICK`

Sets whether to automatically switch to the phone list when a brand button is clicked in the mobile UI.

- Choose `true` or `false`.

#### `TARGET`

Specifies settings related to the Target selector. ##### `ALLOW_MULTIPLE_LINE_PER_TYPE`
Sets whether to display the Target list in multiple lines per type. - Choose `true` or `false`. ##### `OMIT_TARGET_SUFFIX`
Sets whether to omit the 'Target' suffix for each target item. - Choose `true` or `false`. ##### `COLLAPSE_TARGET_LIST_ON_INITIAL`
Sets whether the target list is collapsed on initial page load. - Choose `true` or `false`.

#### `HIDE_DEV_DONATE_BUTTON`

Sets whether to hide the 'Donate' button.

- Choose `true` or `false`.

### `URL`

```javascript
URL: {
  AUTO_UPDATE_URL: true,
  COMPRESS_URL: true,
},
```

- `AUTO_UPDATE_URL`: Sets whether to automatically update the URL according to the selected device and target.
  - Choose `true` or `false`.
- `COMPRESS_URL`: Sets whether to compress the URL.
  - When activated, the URL is compressed using the base62 algorithm.
  - Choose `true` or `false`.

### `RANKING_URL`

```javascript
// Default — no link, review score renders as plain text:
RANKING_URL: "",

// Link to a squigRanking page on the same deploy, anchored to the device card:
RANKING_URL: "/ranking/?type=earphone#{slug}",

// External ranking page:
RANKING_URL: "https://reviews.example.com/?type={type}#{slug}",

// Raw URL with no per-device anchoring (no placeholders → used verbatim):
RANKING_URL: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/.../pubhtml",
```

Wraps the per-phone review score in the device selector with a clickable link to your ranking page (e.g. [squigRanking](https://github.com/potatosalad775/squigRanking)). When empty (the default), the score renders as plain text — there is no behavior change for existing deploys.

The value is a URL template. modernGraphTool substitutes the following placeholders per row at render time. Values are URL-encoded (except `{slug}`, which keeps `-` readable).

| Placeholder  | Expands to                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{brand}`    | The phone's brand                                                                              |
| `{model}`    | The phone's model                                                                              |
| `{slug}`     | `{brand}-{model}` lowercased, whitespace → `-` (matches squigRanking's `deepLink` slug format) |
| `{fullName}` | `{brand} {model}` joined                                                                       |
| `{type}`     | Always `earphone` — see note below                                                             |

If the template contains **no** placeholders (e.g. a Google Sheet URL), it is used verbatim — no slug or query string is appended.

:::note[`{type}` on headphone deploys]
modernGraphTool's `phone_book.json` does not record device type per phone, so `{type}` always resolves to the literal `earphone`. For a headphone-only deploy, hardcode the type instead — e.g. `RANKING_URL: "/ranking/?type=headphone#{slug}"`.
:::

### `CDN_MODE`

```javascript
CDN_MODE: {
  MAJOR_VERSION: 2,
  // BASE: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool@cdn",
  // BASE_PATH: "/headphones",
  // VERSIONS_URL: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/cdn/versions.json",
},
```

Configures CDN deployment settings. **Only used when deploying with `cdn-index.html`** — leave this section commented out for standard `dist/` deployments.

- `MAJOR_VERSION`: Pins the app to a specific major version (e.g., `2` means auto-update within v2.x.x).
- `BASE`: Custom CDN base URL. Only change this if you're hosting the CDN assets yourself (advanced use).
- `BASE_PATH`: Deployment subpath (e.g. `"/headphones"`), with no trailing slash. **Required for any deployment not at the (sub)domain root.** For a site at `example.com/headphones/` or `username.squig.link/headphones/`, set `BASE_PATH: "/headphones"`. Only leave this unset if your site is served at the root of its (sub)domain — e.g. `example.com/` or `username.squig.link/`. Without it, share-link deep routes will 404 even though the home page loads fine. For the full explanation of why this is effectively always required, see the [CDN deployment guide](./deployment/cdn.mdx#why-base_path-is-almost-always-required).
- `VERSIONS_URL`: Full URL to `versions.json`. By default, the loader derives a `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL from `BASE` and fetches `versions.json` directly from GitHub — **not** through jsDelivr. This is intentional: jsDelivr's edge cache can pin stale `versions.json` responses for hours, which delays new releases from reaching users. `versions.json` is the one file where that matters, so the loader sidesteps it. Only override `VERSIONS_URL` if you host your own fork of the `cdn` branch or serve from a non-GitHub origin.

:::note[Standard Deployment]
If you are using the [Pre-built Release](./deployment/prebuilt.mdx) method (uploading the full `dist/` folder), you do not need this section. It is only relevant for [CDN deployments](./deployment/cdn.mdx) using `cdn-index.html`.
:::

### `LANGUAGE`

```javascript
LANGUAGE: {
  LANGUAGE_LIST: [
    ["en", "English"], ["ko", "한국어"]
  ],
  ENABLE_I18N: true,
  ENABLE_SYSTEM_LANG_DETECTION: true,
},
```

- `LANGUAGE_LIST`: Sets the list of available languages.
  - Add each language in the format `["language_code", "language_name"]`.
- `ENABLE_I18N`: Sets whether to enable multilingual support.
  - If disabled, the language selection UI is removed, and only English is displayed.
  - Choose `true` or `false`.
- `ENABLE_SYSTEM_LANG_DETECTION`: Sets whether to detect the user's system language automatically.
  - Choose `true` or `false`.

### `PATH`

```javascript
PATH: {
  PHONE_MEASUREMENT: "./data/phones",
  TARGET_MEASUREMENT: "./data/target",
  PHONE_BOOK: "./data/phone_book.json",
},
```

- `PHONE_MEASUREMENT`: Sets the folder path where Phone (measurement data) files are stored.
- `TARGET_MEASUREMENT`: Sets the folder path where Target (target curve) files are stored.
- `PHONE_BOOK`: Sets the file path for `phone_book.json`, which records Phone (measurement data) information.

:::caution[Caution]
It is recommended **not to modify** the data file paths unless absolutely necessary. Modifying the path of the `phone_book.json` file, in particular, may cause compatibility issues with services like squig.link.
:::

### `WATERMARK`

```javascript
WATERMARK: [
  {
    TYPE: "TEXT",
    CONTENT: "© 2025 modernGraphTool", LOCATION: "BOTTOM_RIGHT",
    SIZE: "15px", FONT_FAMILY: "sans-serif", FONT_WEIGHT: "600", COLOR: "#000000", OPACITY: "0.4",
  },
  // You can even put multiple TEXT or IMAGE in Array.
  // Randomly picked content will be rendered on every load.
  {
    TYPE: "IMAGE",
    SIZE: "50px", LOCATION: "TOP_LEFT", POSITION: {UP: "20", DOWN: "0", LEFT: "0", RIGHT: "10"}, OPACITY: "0.2",
    CONTENT: [
      "./assets/images/icon_1.png", "./assets/images/icon_2.png", "./assets/images/icon_3.png",
    ]
  }
],
```

Sets the watermark to be displayed on the graph.

- Multiple watermarks can be displayed simultaneously. Each watermark is distinguished by a `{}` object.
- modernGraphTool supports two types of watermarks: `TEXT` and `IMAGE`.
  - Specify the watermark type with the `TYPE` field within the object.

:::tip[Tip]
Images used in modernGraphTool can be located in any path, but it is recommended to place them in the `assets/images` folder.
:::

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="TEXT">
		- `TYPE` : Specifies the watermark type. - Set to `TEXT`. - `CONTENT` : Sets the text to be
		displayed in the watermark. - Multiple strings can be entered in array format (enclosed in
		`[]`). - If 2 or more strings are specified, a randomly selected string will be displayed on
		initial load. - `LOCATION` : Sets the watermark position. - Choose from `TOP_LEFT`, `TOP_RIGHT`,
		`BOTTOM_LEFT`, `BOTTOM_RIGHT`. - `SIZE` : Sets the watermark size (in px). - `FONT_FAMILY` :
		Sets the watermark font. - `FONT_WEIGHT` : Sets the watermark font weight (a multiple of 100
		from 100 to 900). - `COLOR` : Sets the watermark color (HEX code). - `OPACITY` : Sets the
		watermark opacity (0 to 1).
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="IMAGE">
		- `TYPE` : Specifies the watermark type. - Set to `IMAGE`. - `CONTENT` : Sets the image file
		path to be displayed in the watermark. - Multiple image file paths can be entered in array
		format (enclosed in `[]`). - If 2 or more image paths are specified, a randomly selected image
		will be displayed on initial load. - `LOCATION` : Sets the watermark position. - Choose from
		`TOP_LEFT`, `TOP_RIGHT`, `BOTTOM_LEFT`, `BOTTOM_RIGHT`. - `SIZE` : Sets the watermark size (in
		px). - `POSITION` : Fine-tunes the watermark position. - Set the top, bottom, left, and right
		positions of the watermark with the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` fields (in px). - `OPACITY` :
		Sets the watermark opacity (0 to 1).
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `TARGET_MANIFEST`

```javascript
TARGET_MANIFEST: [
  { type:"Harman",      files:["Harman IE 2019v2","Harman IE 2017v2"] },
  { type:"Neutral",     files:["KEMAR DF (KB006x)","ISO 11904-2 DF","IEF Neutral 2023"] },
  { type:"Reviewer",    files:["Banbeucmas","HBB","Precogvision","Super 22 Adjusted"] },
  { type:"Preference",  files:["AutoEQ","Rtings","Sonarworks"] },
  { type:"Δ",           files:["Universal ∆"] }
],
```

Defines how targets displayed in the Target selector are grouped and sorted.

- The `type` field defines the name of the target group.
- The `files` field specifies the file names of the targets belonging to that group in array format.

:::tip[Multilingual Support]
`TARGET_MANIFEST` supports multilingual configuration. See the [Multilingual Support](#multilingual-support-configjs) section below for details.
:::

### `SAMPLES`

```javascript
SAMPLES: {
  DEFAULT_COUNT: 1,
  DEFAULT_DISPLAY: ["avg"],
  FILL_OPACITY: 0.3,
},
```

Site-wide defaults for **sample sets** — variants measured more than once (repeat
runs, seating positions, one measurement per ear pad). See
[Sample Sets](./manage-data.mdx#sample-sets) for the `phone_book.json` side.

- `DEFAULT_COUNT`: How many runs a variant has when it declares no `samples` of its
  own. Leave at `1` unless every device in your database is measured the same number
  of times — then set it once here instead of on every entry.
- `DEFAULT_DISPLAY`: How a sample set is drawn when it declares no `display`. Any
  combination of:
  - `"avg"` — the averaged curve across every run.
  - `"curves"` — each run as its own toggleable curve.
  - `"fill"` — a shaded min/max band across the runs.
    `["avg", "fill"]` gives an averaged line with a variance band around it.
- `FILL_OPACITY`: Opacity of the fill band (0 to 1).

:::note[Deprecated: `MULTI_SAMPLE` and `HPTF`]
`SAMPLES` replaces both, and the old sections **will be removed in a future release**.
They are still read as a fallback today, so an existing `config.js` keeps working
unchanged — but set `SAMPLES` and delete them when you next touch the file. The
[Config Editor](/config-generator) does the translation for you: import your current
`config.js` and export it again. The same goes for the `hptfs[]` key in
`phone_book.json` — see [Managing Data](./manage-data.mdx#deprecated-hptfs).

- `MULTI_SAMPLE.DEFAULT_DISPLAY: "average"` → `DEFAULT_DISPLAY: ["avg"]`
- `MULTI_SAMPLE.DEFAULT_DISPLAY: "all"` → `DEFAULT_DISPLAY: ["avg", "curves"]`
- `HPTF.FILL_OPACITY` → `SAMPLES.FILL_OPACITY`

`HPTF.DEFAULT_DISPLAY` has no `SAMPLES` equivalent. It applies only to the legacy
`hptfs[]` entries in `phone_book.json` and does not set a site-wide default for

### `TRACE_STYLING`

```javascript
TRACE_STYLING: {
  PHONE_TRACE_THICKNESS: 2,
  TARGET_TRACE_THICKNESS: 1,
  CURVE_COLOR_PALETTE: [
    "#0072B2", "#E69F00", "#009E73", "#CC79A7",
    "#56B4E9", "#D55E00", "#F0E442", "#000000",
  ],
  CURVE_COLOR_PALETTE_RANDOMIZE: false,
  TARGET_TRACE_DASH: [{ name: "KEMAR DF (KB006x)", dash: "10 10" }],
},
```

Sets the thickness, dash style, color palette, etc., of graph lines. You can also specify different line styles for specific targets.

- `PHONE_TRACE_THICKNESS` : Sets the thickness of Phone (measurement data) graph lines (in px).
- `TARGET_TRACE_THICKNESS` : Sets the thickness of Target (target curve) graph lines (in px).
- `CURVE_COLOR_PALETTE` : Curated palette consumed in order when assigning a color to a newly added curve.
  - Accepts any CSS color string (`#hex`, `oklch(...)`, `hsl(...)`, `rgb(...)`).
  - Once exhausted (or every preset is too close to a color the user already manually picked), modernGraphTool falls back to OKLCH-based generation that picks the next color farthest in perceptual distance from every color already on the graph.
  - Leave empty or omit to use the built-in [Okabe-Ito](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/) default (8 colorblind-safe colors).
- `CURVE_COLOR_PALETTE_RANDOMIZE` : When `true`, `CURVE_COLOR_PALETTE` is shuffled once per page load so each session starts from a different color.
  - The shuffled order stays stable within the session, so add / undo / redo remain consistent.
  - Has no effect when `CURVE_COLOR_PALETTE` is empty or omitted.
  - Defaults to `false`.
- `TARGET_TRACE_DASH` : Sets the line style for a specific target.
  - The `name` field specifies the target's name.
  - The `dash` field sets the target's line style.
    - Accepts values according to the 'stroke-dasharray' attribute. For a detailed explanation, refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/stroke-dasharray).
    - Setting to `0 1` will not display the line.
    - Setting to `null` will display the line as solid.

### `TOPBAR`

```javascript
TOPBAR: {
  TITLE: {
    //TYPE: "TEXT", CONTENT: "modernGraphTool",
    //TYPE: "IMAGE", CONTENT: "./assets/images/sample.jpg",
    TYPE: "HTML", CONTENT: "<h2>modernGraphTool</h2>",
  },
  LINK_LIST: [
    { TITLE: "Home", URL: "/" },
    { TITLE: "Docs", URL: "https://example.com/docs" },
  ],
},
```

Sets the title and link list for the page's top bar.

- `TITLE` : Sets the title for the page's top bar.
  - `TYPE` : Specifies the title type.
    - Set to `TEXT` to display a text-formatted title.
    - Set to `IMAGE` to display an image-formatted title.
    - Set to `HTML` to display an HTML-formatted title.
  - `CONTENT` : Sets the title content.
    - If `TYPE` is `TEXT`, sets a text-formatted title.
    - If `TYPE` is `IMAGE`, sets an image file path.
    - If `TYPE` is `HTML`, sets an HTML-formatted title.
- `LINK_LIST` : Sets the link list for the page's top bar.
  - The `TITLE` field specifies the link's title.
  - The `URL` field specifies the link's URL.
  - You must include `http(s)://` for external URLs.

:::tip[Multilingual Support]
`LINK_LIST` supports multilingual configuration. See the [Multilingual Support](#multilingual-support-configjs) section below for details.

### `PREFERENCE_BOUND`

```javascript
PREFERENCE_BOUND: {
  ENABLE_BOUND_ON_INITIAL_LOAD: false,
  BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE: "KEMAR DF (KB006x) Target",
  COLOR_FILL: "rgba(180,180,180,0.2)",
  COLOR_BORDER: "rgba(120,120,120,0.5)",
},
```

Configures the preference bound overlay that draws a shaded upper/lower preference range on the graph.

- `ENABLE_BOUND_ON_INITIAL_LOAD`: Shows bounds immediately on page load.
  - Choose `true` or `false`.
- `BASE_DF_TARGET_FILE`: The reference DF target file used for compensation.
- `COLOR_FILL`: Fill color of the shaded area (CSS color value).
- `COLOR_BORDER`: Border color of the shaded area (CSS color value).

:::note[Data Files]
Bound data files (`Bounds U.txt` / `Bounds D.txt`) must exist in the `data/` folder for the preference bound to display.
:::

### `TARGET_CUSTOMIZER`

```javascript
TARGET_CUSTOMIZER: {
  CUSTOMIZABLE_TARGETS: ["KEMAR DF (KB006x) Target", "ISO 11904-2 DF"],
  FILTERS: [
    { id: "tilt", name: "Tilt", type: "TILT", freq: 0, q: 0 },
    { id: "bass", name: "Bass", type: "LSQ", freq: 105, q: 0.707 },
    { id: "treble", name: "Treble", type: "HSQ", freq: 2500, q: 0.42 },
    { id: "ear", name: "Ear", type: "PK", freq: 2750, q: 1 },
    { id: "pssr", name: "PSSR", type: "HSQ", freq: 500, q: 0.4 },
  ],
  FILTER_PRESET: [
    { name: "Harman 2013", filter: { bass: 6.6, treble: -1.4 } },
    { name: "Harman 2015", filter: { bass: 6.6, treble: -3, ear: -1.8 } },
    { name: "Harman 2018", filter: { bass: 4.8, treble: -4.4 } },
  ],
  INITIAL_TARGET_FILTERS: [
    { name: "KEMAR DF (KB006x)", filter: { tilt: -0.8, bass: 6 } },
    { name: "ISO 11904-2 DF", filter: { tilt: -0.8, bass: 6 } },
  ],
},
```

Configures the target customizer, which allows per-target filter adjustments for specified target curves.

Only `CUSTOMIZABLE_TARGETS` is required. `FILTERS` defaults to Tilt / Bass / Treble / Ear, and `FILTER_PRESET` to the three Harman presets shown above — omit both unless you want something different.

:::caution[`FILTERS` replaces the list, it does not extend it]
Setting `FILTERS` discards the four built-in filters entirely. If you are adding one filter, restate the built-ins you want to keep alongside it. The shipped `config.js` carries a commented-out example that does exactly this, adding the Harman 2025 MoA set on top of the defaults.
:::

- `CUSTOMIZABLE_TARGETS`: Array of target file names that can be customized.
- `FILTERS`: Available filter definitions. Each filter has:
  - `id` — Unique identifier for the filter.
  - `name` — Display name.
  - `type` — Filter type: `TILT`, `LSQ` (Low Shelf), `HSQ` (High Shelf), or `PK` (Peaking).
  - `freq` — Center/corner frequency in Hz.
  - `q` — Q factor (bandwidth).
- `FILTER_PRESET`: Preset filter configurations selectable from a dropdown.
  - `name` — Preset display name.
  - `filter` — Object mapping filter IDs to gain values.
- `INITIAL_TARGET_FILTERS`: Automatically applied filters on initial page load.
  - `name` — Target name to apply filters to.
  - `filter` — Object mapping filter IDs to gain values.

### `CROSS_SITE_SEARCH`

```javascript
CROSS_SITE_SEARCH: {
  ENABLED: true,
  INDEX_URLS: [],
},
```

Lets visitors search other measurement databases from your search box. Works on any host — squig.link is not required. See [Cross-Site Search](../features/cross-site-search.mdx).

- `ENABLED`: Enables cross-site device search.
- `INDEX_URLS`: Index documents to try, in order. Leave empty to use the official [GraphAggregator](https://github.com/HarutoHiroki/GraphAggregator) index and its GitHub Pages mirror. Set your own URLs to self-host an index following the same schema.

### `SITE_SELECTOR`

```javascript
SITE_SELECTOR: {
  ENABLED: 'auto',
  INDEX_URLS: [],
},
```

Adds a top-bar dropdown for switching between measurement databases across sites. Works on any host — squig.link is not required. See [Site Selector](../features/site-selector.mdx).

- `ENABLED`: `'auto'` shows the selector only when this deployment is listed in the shared index (register at [graphaggregator.harutohiroki.com](https://graphaggregator.harutohiroki.com/)) or is hosted on squig.link. `true` always shows it; `false` never does and skips the fetch.
- `INDEX_URLS`: Directory documents to try, in order. Leave empty to use the official [GAA](https://github.com/potatosalad775/GAA) index. Set your own URLs to self-host one following the same schema.

### `DOWNLOAD`

```javascript
DOWNLOAD: {
  ENABLED: true,
},
```

Adds a per-curve download button to the selection list. Exports the curve exactly as displayed — smoothing, normalization, target adjustments and parametric EQ are all baked in — as one tab-separated `Frequency` / `dB` `.txt` file per channel (`Name Suffix L.txt`, `Name Suffix R.txt`, …).

- `ENABLED`: Shows the download button. Off by default.

### `EQUALIZER`

```javascript
EQUALIZER: {
  AUTOEQ_DEFAULT_BAND_COUNT: 8,
},
```

Defaults for the Equalizer panel. See [Equalizer](../features/equalizer.mdx).

- `AUTOEQ_DEFAULT_BAND_COUNT`: How many filter bands **Run AutoEQ** generates when the filter list is empty. Defaults to `8`. A non-empty list always wins, so users can still pick a count by adding or removing bands before running. Values below `1` are ignored, and the active constraint preset's band cap still applies — a connected 5-band device gets 5.

### `SQUIGLINK`

```javascript
SQUIGLINK: {
  ENABLED: true,
  ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_IDS: [],
  ANALYTICS_SITE: "",
  LOG_ANALYTICS: true,
  ENABLE_ANALYTICS: true,
  ENABLE_CROSS_SITE_SEARCH: true,
  ENABLE_SPONSOR: true,
},
```

Configures the squig.link integration. These features are only active when hosted on `*.squig.link` domains.

- `ENABLED`: Master toggle for squig.link integration.
- `ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_IDS`: Array of GA4 measurement IDs, e.g., `["G-SQUIGLINK_ID", "G-YOUR_ID"]`.
- `ANALYTICS_SITE`: Site name used for analytics attribution.
- `LOG_ANALYTICS`: Whether to log analytics events to the browser console.
- `ENABLE_ANALYTICS`: Master toggle for analytics tracking.
- `ENABLE_CROSS_SITE_SEARCH`: **Deprecated** — use `CROSS_SITE_SEARCH.ENABLED`. Still read as a fallback for configs that predate that section.
- `ENABLE_SPONSOR`: Enables sponsor banner and shop link features.

### `DESCRIPTION`

```javascript
DESCRIPTION: [
  //{ TYPE: "TEXT", CONTENT: "Every measurements are done by using IEC 60318-4 (711) Ear Simulator." },
  { TYPE: "HTML", CONTENT: "<p>Every measurements are done by using IEC 60318-4 (711) Ear Simulator.</p>" },
],
```

Adds the text / image / HTML element to the 'description' area of the Misc panel.
Multiple descriptions can be added simultaneously. Each description is distinguished by a `{}` object.

- `TYPE` : Specifies the content type.
  - Set to `TEXT` to display plain text.
  - Set to `IMAGE` to display an image.
  - Set to `HTML` to display HTML-formatted content.
- `CONTENT` : Sets the content.
  - If `TYPE` is `TEXT`, sets a text string.
  - If `TYPE` is `IMAGE`, sets an image file path.
  - If `TYPE` is `HTML`, sets HTML-formatted content.

:::tip[Multilingual Support]
`DESCRIPTION` supports multilingual configuration. See the [Multilingual Support](#multilingual-support-configjs) section below for details.
:::

## Multilingual Support (`config.js`)

Some items in `config.js` can be written in languages other than English.

- To enable multilingual support, you need to modify the `LANGUAGE` item in the `config.js` file.
- The items that support multilingual configuration are:
  - `TARGET_MANIFEST`
  - `TOPBAR` → `LINK_LIST`
  - `DESCRIPTION`

```javascript
// Example: TOPBAR.LINK_LIST with multilingual support
TOPBAR: {
  LINK_LIST: {
    default: [
      { TITLE: "Google", URL: "https://www.google.com" },
      { TITLE: "Github", URL: "https://www.github.com" },
    ],
    i18n: {
      ko: [
        { TITLE: "구글", URL: "https://www.google.com" },
        { TITLE: "깃허브", URL: "https://www.github.com" },
      ]
    }
  },
},
```

For multilingual support items, objects written in the default language (English) should be in the `default` field, and objects written in other languages should be in the `i18n` field.

- The `i18n` field must have an object that matches the language code registered in the `LANGUAGE_LIST` item within the `LANGUAGE` item.
- If you don't need multilingual support, you can use the simpler flat array format (without `default` and `i18n` wrappers).
