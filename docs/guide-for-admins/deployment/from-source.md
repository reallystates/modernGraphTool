Clone the modernGraphTool repository, customize whatever you like, and build your own `dist/` folder. This path is aimed at developers and operators who need changes that go beyond what `config.js` exposes.

## Overview

Building from source gives you full control over the app bundle itself — you can edit components, add features, change the build pipeline, and ship custom releases. It's also the most work: you need Node.js, `git`, and the ability to debug build errors.

If you only want to customize `config.js`, `theme.css`, `data/`, or `assets/`, you don't need to build from source — use [CDN Deployment](./cdn.mdx) or [Pre-built Release](./prebuilt.mdx) instead.

## When to pick this

**Good fit for:**

- Forks with custom features beyond what the config surface exposes
- Developers who want to contribute upstream
- Operators who need to edit app components, routes, or build configuration

**Bad fit for:**

- Operators who just want a working site — use CDN or Pre-built
- People who don't want to deal with `node_modules` and build errors

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or later
- `git`
- Basic command-line familiarity

## Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool.git
cd modernGraphTool
npm install
```

## `defaults/` vs `static/`

modernGraphTool uses a two-layer static assets system. Understanding it before you start editing will save you a lot of time.

- **`defaults/`** holds user-configurable templates: `config.js`, `theme.css`, `data/`, `assets/`, and so on. These are the files a regular operator would edit. They're checked into git and ship with every release.
- **`static/`** is a gitignored override layer. Any file you place in `static/` takes priority over the same path in `defaults/` — during `npm run dev` and during `npm run build`.

**Pattern for customizing while developing:** copy the file you want to edit from `defaults/` into `static/`, then edit the copy in `static/`. This keeps your personal customizations out of git and makes `git pull` painless.

The fallback behavior is implemented by [vite-plugin-defaults.ts](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/blob/main/vite-plugin-defaults.ts), which serves `defaults/` as a fallback during dev and copies it into `dist/` after the build (without overwriting files from `static/`).

:::caution[Don't import from defaults/ or static/ as modules]
Files in `defaults/` and `static/` are runtime-loaded assets, not bundled modules. Use `fetch()` at runtime to read them — never `import` them from source.
:::

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` with hot module reload. Edits to `.svelte`, `.ts`, `.css`, and `defaults/` files all reload live.

If you want to test against your own measurement data, drop your `data/` folder into `static/data/` — the dev server will serve your files instead of the shipped defaults.

## Previewing the production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

`npm run build` produces `dist/`, and `npm run preview` serves that built folder locally. This is how you verify the production bundle before uploading. The preview server runs at `http://localhost:4173` by default.

## Type checking and quality gates

```bash
npm run check          # TypeScript + Svelte type checking
npm run lint           # Prettier + ESLint
npm run test           # Vitest unit tests
npm run format         # Auto-fix formatting
```

Run `npm run check` and `npm run test` before shipping any custom build — they catch most integration issues before they reach users.

## Building and deploying

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output goes to `dist/`. From there, deployment is identical to [Pre-built Release](./prebuilt.mdx) — upload the folder to your web server, make sure the SPA fallback is configured (`.htaccess` for Apache, or equivalent for other servers).

If you also want a CDN-mode build for your own mirror, run:

```bash
npm run build:cdn
```

This produces a `dist-cdn/` folder containing the versioned bundle structure that a CDN loader expects.

## Updating from upstream

```bash
git pull
npm install
npm run build
```

If you've been editing files in `defaults/` directly (instead of copying them to `static/`), expect merge conflicts on upstream updates. The clean fix is to move your customizations to `static/` once, then `git pull` stops conflicting with your edits forever.

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with TypeScript errors

**Cause:** Usually a stale `.svelte-kit/` directory after a `git pull`.

**Fix:** Run `npm run prepare` (which runs `svelte-kit sync`), then retry `npm run build`. If it still fails, delete `node_modules/` and `.svelte-kit/` and reinstall.

### `npm run dev` fails with a port conflict

**Cause:** Port 5173 is already in use (another Vite instance, or another dev server).

**Fix:** Either stop the other process or pass `--port` to Vite: `npm run dev -- --port 5174`.

### My edits to `defaults/config.js` aren't showing up

**Cause:** You have a `static/config.js` that's shadowing it.

**Fix:** Edit `static/config.js` instead, or remove it if you want `defaults/` to take over.

### Tests fail on a fresh clone

**Cause:** Missing the Paraglide i18n code generation step.

**Fix:** Run `npm run prepare` before running tests — it runs `svelte-kit sync`, which among other things triggers the Paraglide compile step.
