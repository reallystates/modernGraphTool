Download a pre-built modernGraphTool release and host the entire `dist/` folder on your own server. This gives you full control over when and which version runs, at the cost of manual updates.

## Overview

A pre-built release is a self-contained static site. You unzip it, drop your config and data in, and upload the whole folder to your web server. There's no runtime dependency on jsDelivr, no version-detection magic, and no auto-updates — you control exactly what users see.

## When to pick this

**Good fit for:**

- Controlled update cadence (you decide when a new version ships)
- Airgapped, intranet, or otherwise jsDelivr-unreachable environments

**Bad fit for:**

- Operators who don't want to re-upload files on every release

## Installation

1.  **Download** the [latest release zip](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/releases).
2.  **Extract the zip.** The extracted folder is a complete site — everything you need to deploy.
3.  **Customize the configuration files:**
    - `config.js` — application settings (see [Customizing the Page](../customize-page.mdx))
    - `theme.css` — graph color theme (see [Customizing Page Styles](../customize-page.mdx#customizing-page-styles-themecss))
    - `data/` — measurement data and target curves (see [Managing Data](../manage-data.mdx))
4.  **Upload the entire folder** to your web server via FTP or any file-transfer method. That's it — open the page in a browser and verify it loads.

## Folder structure

After extracting the release, you'll see something like this:

```
dist/                     # (or extracted release folder)
├── config.js             # Application settings — YOU EDIT
├── theme.css             # Graph color theme — YOU EDIT
├── index.html            # HTML entry point — editable for metadata
├── .htaccess             # Apache SPA fallback
├── data/
│   ├── phones/           # Measurement data files (.txt) — YOU EDIT
│   ├── target/           # Target curve data files (.txt) — YOU EDIT
│   ├── phone_book.json   # Device list definition — YOU EDIT
│   ├── Bounds U.txt      # Preference Bound upper (optional) — YOU EDIT
│   └── Bounds D.txt      # Preference Bound lower (optional) — YOU EDIT
├── assets/               # Images, strings, etc. — YOU EDIT
└── _app/                 # Built application bundle — DO NOT EDIT
```

Files marked **YOU EDIT** are safe to customize. The `_app/` folder contains the built application and should be left alone — it's overwritten on every release update.

## Updating the app

Pre-built releases need manual updates. The safe procedure:

1.  **Back up your current deployment.** Keep a copy of `config.js`, `theme.css`, `data/`, `assets/`, and any customized `index.html`.
2.  **Download the new release** from the [releases page](https://github.com/potatosalad775/modernGraphTool/releases) and extract it.
3.  **Copy your customized files back in:**
    - `config.js`
    - `theme.css`
    - `data/` (entire folder — phones, targets, `phone_book.json`, bounds)
    - `assets/` (entire folder)
    - `index.html` — **only if you've customized it** (OG tags, analytics, etc.). Otherwise use the new release's `index.html` so you pick up any upstream improvements.
4.  **Upload the merged folder** to your server, overwriting the old deployment.
5.  **Check the [changelog](../../changelog.mdx)** for any config schema changes that need your attention.

:::caution[Don't overwrite your data]
The most common update mistake is extracting the new release directly over your live deployment. This overwrites `config.js`, `data/`, etc. with the default release templates. Always back up or copy out first.

## Troubleshooting

### Data doesn't appear in the device selector

**Cause:** `PATH` configuration in `config.js` doesn't match your actual folder layout, or `phone_book.json` is missing / malformed.

**Fix:** Verify the paths in `PATH` (`PHONE_MEASUREMENT`, `TARGET_MEASUREMENT`, `PHONE_BOOK`) point at real files. Open the browser's network tab and check which request is 404ing. See [Managing Data](../manage-data.mdx) for the expected layout.

### Site works locally but not on the server

**Cause:** Case sensitivity. Windows and macOS filesystems are case-insensitive by default; most Linux web servers are not. A file named `Harman IE 2019v2.txt` on disk won't match a request for `harman ie 2019v2.txt`.

**Fix:** Match your filenames exactly to the `phone_book.json` entries, including case.

### Preference Bound doesn't render

**Cause:** `Bounds U.txt` and `Bounds D.txt` aren't in `data/`.

**Fix:** Place both files directly in `data/` (not in a subfolder). See the [Preference Bound feature doc](../../features/preference-bound.mdx) for the file format.
