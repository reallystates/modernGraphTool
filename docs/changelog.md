### v2.1.8

- Feat: Added an "Average" option to combine all visible measurements into a single averaged curve.
- Feat: The site selector can now switch between any deployment listed in the shared site index, not just squig.link-hosted ones.
- Feat: The Equalizer now turns itself on automatically when you import a filter file, run AutoEQ, pull a device's PEQ, or add your first filter band.
- Feat: Running AutoEQ on an empty filter list now defaults to eight bands instead of one.
- Refactor: Selected devices are now pinned to the top of the device list.
- Refactor: Exported EQ filter files now include the device/target model name.
- Fix: The EQ sweep tone now correctly spans your selected listening range instead of collapsing to one edge.

### v2.1.7

- Feat: Phone entries can now carry a rich `description` (a small inline HTML subset — links, emphasis, etc.) and a `links[]` array of operator-defined links shown alongside the built-in Review / Shop links. See [Rich Descriptions](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx#rich-descriptions) and [Custom Links](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx#custom-links).
- Fix: `variants[]` now composes with the phone-level `file` / `suffix` / `prefix` / `samples` / `hptfs` form instead of discarding it, so a database can use Sample Sets without losing CrinGraph compatibility. See [Sample Sets](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx#sample-sets).

### v2.1.6

- Feat: Unified multi-sample and HpTF measurements into one **Sample Set** concept. A variant measured more than once can now be drawn as an averaged curve, per-run curves, a shaded min/max deviation band, or any combination — including "averaged line with a variance band", which neither old form could express. Declare it per variant with the new `variants[]` schema. See [Sample Sets documentation](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx#sample-sets).
- Feat: New `SAMPLES` config section (`DEFAULT_COUNT`, `DEFAULT_DISPLAY`, `FILL_OPACITY`), replacing `MULTI_SAMPLE` and `HPTF`. A site-wide default run count means a uniformly multi-sampled database needs no per-entry setting. See [SAMPLES documentation](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#samples).
- Feat: An individual sample curve now has its own L, R and AVG toggles.
- Feat: Added a new `DOWNLOAD` option to the `config.js` that allows users to export measurement curves. Disabled by default. See more at [DOWNLOAD documentation](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#download).
- Fix: The on-graph label now updates as individual runs are toggled, and the hover readout reports runs from every kind of sample set.
- Fix: The averaged curve of a multi-sample device can now be hidden, and individual runs keep their true spread at the normalization frequency instead of being flattened onto it.
- Deprecated: The modernGraphTool-specific `hptfs[]` key and the `MULTI_SAMPLE` / `HPTF` config sections still load, but will be removed in a future release. Convert your files by importing and re-exporting them in the [phone_book.json Editor](/phone-book-editor) and the [Config Editor](/config-generator). See [Deprecated: `hptfs[]`](./guide-for-admins/manage-data.mdx#deprecated-hptfs).

### v2.1.5

- Feat: Reworked the Equalizer with the new sine sweep audio source, a History & Compare panel with A/B mode switching, and full undo/redo for filter edits.
- Feat: Cross-Site Search now queries the GraphAggregator index, replacing the per-site squig.link crawl for faster and more reliable results across measurement databases.
- Localization: Added Czech language support. (by @adam664)
- Fix: Fixed numerous EQ issues, including bypass loudness matching, the `\` momentary bypass key, and more.
- Fix: Fixed baseline graph rendering inconsistencies, and Preference Bound issue with mobile devices.
- Fix: Fixed several data-sync edge cases around undo/redo, variant removal, and target duplication.

### v2.1.4

- Localization: Added new translations for Russian and Ukrainian languages (by @reallystates)
- Fix: Added tiny buffer MenuCarousel buttons to prevent unintended ellipsis via sub-pixel rounding

### v2.1.3

- Refactor: 'Upload FR' button now automatically handles L/R channel files based on its name.
- Refactor: MenuCarousel buttons now adjust its width based on the inner text length, preventing overflow issues with longer translations.
- Fix: Fixed an issue with L/R channel position mismatch

### v2.1.2

- Fix: Fixed an issue where color randomizer was not working properly.
- Fix: Fixed an issue where Preference Bound was not properly following y-axis position adjustment via graph handle.
- Fix: Normalization now shifts a device's left and right channels by the same amount, so the displayed L/R gap reflects the true channel imbalance instead of being flattened at the normalization point.

### v2.1.1

- Feat: Added a new "CURVE_COLOR_PALETTE" field in the `config.js` that allows users to customize the color palette used for device curves. See more at [TRACE_STYLING documentation](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#trace_styling).
- Feat: Added a new "PANEL_POSITION" field in the `config.js` that allows users to customize the position of the menu panel on the desktop interface. See more at [INTERFACE documentation](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#interface).
- Refactor: Updated audio player to keep the same instance across navigations, allowing it to maintain playback state and position when switching between various panels.
- Change: Menu panel is now positioned on the left side of the desktop interface by default, following common UI conventions from CrinGraph.
- Change: Added a toast notification that is shown when a new version of modernGraphTool is loaded.
- Refactor (squig-link): Improved cross-site search performance.

### v2.1.0

- Feat: Added a new "RANKING_URL" field in the `config.js` that changes the ranking indicator in the device selector to link to a custom URL. See more at [RANKING_URL documentation](./guide-for-admins/customize-page.mdx#ranking_url)
- Fix: Fixed an issue where y-axis scale button was not properly initialized with configured default value on page load.
- Fix: Fixed an issue where entire devices went missing when single entry in the phone book had an invalid format, instead of just that entry being skipped.

### v2.0.9

- Fix: Fixed multiple issue with baseline graph rendering, including incorrect baseline display when using certain normalization options and misalignment of baseline elements in some cases.

### v2.0.8

- Fix: Screenshots are now independent of the current theme, ensuring consistent appearance regardless of light/dark mode settings.

### v2.0.7

- Feat: Added a plus button in variant selector to quickly add a new variant of the identical device.
- Feat: EQ and AutoEQ entries are now sorted by types and labels.
- Feat: Added auto-select for EQ and AutoEQ when only one phone and one target are selected.

### v2.0.6

- Feat: Added new EQ settings component with normalization linking and AutoEQ persistence options
- Feat: Added an option to lock the EQ curve to the original graph, keeping its position relative to the original measurements regardless of normalization settings
- Feat: Added an option to remember AutoEQ input values, with choices for current tab only or saving to the browser for all sessions
- Refactor: Updated EQ panel layout to split elements for better organization in wide viewports

### v2.0.5

- Feat: Added devicePEQ info dialog with list of supported devices and instructions
- Refactor: Replaced color scheme for Switch component for better contrast and accessibility
- Refactor: Normalizer input now uses `oninput` event for real-time updates on every keystroke
- Fix: Fixed an issue where HpTF deviation fill could be misaligned in certain normalization options
- Fix: Prevented variant selector from escaping screen
- Fix: Added missing hover effect on several interactive elements

### v2.0.4

- Refactor: Replaced singular `hptf` phone_book field with `hptfs` array. Each hptfs entry becomes its own independent variant
- Refactor: Multi-sample variants now fall back to unnumbered L.txt/R.txt when L1.txt/R1.txt don't exist.
- Refactor: Dropped translation for target adjustment label, as it's user-defined value, not system parameter.
- Fix: HpTF deviation fill now uses the combined L+R envelope when AVG is displayed
- Fix: Variant selector no longer hides the chevron when dispSuffix is empty
- Fix: \_getSuffix returning "0" for explicit empty-string suffix entries

### v2.0.3

- Feat: Added target adjustment label to the graph
- Feat: Added version info in the misc panel
- Fix: Target Customizer not normalizing target name correctly, causing some targets to be missing from the list
- Fix: Target selector's horizontal scrollbar not showing up properly when there are many targets

### v2.0.2
